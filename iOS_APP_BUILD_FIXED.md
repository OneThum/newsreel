# iOS App Build - Fixed ✅

**Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Date:** 2025-10-27

---

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Extra `showImages` Parameter in StoryCard Calls ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
- Lines 1075 and 1548 in `MainAppView.swift` were passing `showImages` parameter to `StoryCard`
- But `StoryCard` signature was updated to remove this parameter
- Error: `extra argument 'showImages' in call`

**Files Affected:**
- `Newsreel App/Newsreel/Views/MainAppView.swift`

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Line 1075: Removed `showImages: showImages` from StoryCard in saved stories section
2. Line 1548: Removed `showImages: localShowImages` from StoryCard in search results section

### 2. Unused Variables from Image Preference Removal ⚠️ → ✅

**Problem:**
- Lines 243-244: Unused `savedValue` and `hasValue` in `onAppear`
- Lines 249-250: Unused `savedValue` and `hasValue` in `onReceive`
- These were remnants from old image preference code
- Warnings: "initialization of immutable value 'X' was never used"

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Removed all unused variable declarations
2. Replaced with explanatory comments noting that image preferences no longer exist
