# Critical Fixes Applied - October 18, 2025, 21:40 UTC

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ❌ Batch Processing Container Access Error
**Error**: `'CosmosDBClient' object has no attribute 'story_clusters_container'`

**Root Cause**: Incorrectly accessing Cosmos DB container as a property instead of using the `_get_container()` method.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before (WRONG):
stories = list(cosmos_client.story_clusters_container.query_items(...))

# After (CORRECT):
container = cosmos_client._get_container(config.CONTAINER_STORY_CLUSTERS)
stories = list(container.query_items(...))
```

**File**: `Azure/functions/function_app.py` line ~1750

### 2. ❌ Swift Compilation Error  
**Error**: `Type 'StatusIndicator' has no member 'degraded'`

**Root Cause**: Used `.degraded` which doesn't exist in the `StatusIndicator` enum.

**Fix Applied**:
```swift
// Before (WRONG):
status: metrics.batchProcessing.enabled ? .healthy : .degraded

// After (CORRECT):
status: metrics.batchProcessing.enabled ? .healthy : .warning
```

## Deployments Completed

| Component | Status | Time |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Azure Functions** | ✅ Deployed | 21:39 UTC |
| **Azure Container App (API)** | ✅ Deployed | 21:41 UTC |
| **iOS App** | ⚠️ Needs Rebuild | Pending |

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test iOS App Admin Dashboard

**Steps**:
1. Rebuild the iOS app in Xcode (clean build recommended)
2. Launch the app
3. Navigate to Settings → Admin Dashboard
4. Verify the page loads without errors
5. Check for new "Batch Processing" section

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ No 500 errors from admin metrics endpoint
- ✅ "Batch Processing" section visible (purple card)
- ✅ Shows status: "Enabled"
- ✅ Other metrics display correctly (may show 0 initially)

### 2. Wait for First Batch Run

**Timeline**: Next batch scheduled for 22:00:00 UTC (~20 minutes)

**What to Watch**:
1. **Function Logs**: Check Application Insights for "Batch submitted"
2. **Cosmos DB**: Query `batch_tracking` container for new records
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Refresh after 22:30 UTC to see batch metrics

**Query to Check Batches**:
```sql
-- In Cosmos DB Data Explorer → batch_tracking container
SELECT * FROM c 
WHERE c.created_at >= '2025-10-18T22:00:00Z'
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC
```

### 3. Verify Batch Processing Works

**After First Batch** (by 22:30 UTC):

Check Function Logs:
```bash
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-insights \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) and message contains 'Batch' | project timestamp, message | order by timestamp desc | take 20"
```

Expected log entries:
- "Batch summarization manager triggered"
- "Found X stories needing summaries"  
- "Submitting batch with X requests"
- "✅ Batch submitted: [batch_id]"

Check Admin Dashboard:
- Batches Submitted (24h): Should show 1+
- Batches Completed (24h): Will show 0 initially (takes 30-60 min)
- Stories in Queue: Should show actual count
- Success Rate: Will show 0.0% until first batch completes

## Known Issues (Not Blockers)

### 1. Empty Feed
**Symptom**: iOS app shows "Received 0 stories from API"

**Cause**: This is separate from batch processing - RSS ingestion may not be running or no recent stories

**Impact**: Does NOT affect batch processing functionality

**To Investigate** (if needed):
- Check RSS ingestion function logs
- Verify Cosmos DB has stories
- Check story_clusters container for recent entries

### 2. Clustering Errors in Logs
**Error**: `StructuredLogger.log_story_cluster() got an unexpected keyword argument 'unique_sources'`

**Impact**: Stories may not be clustering properly

**Priority**: Medium (separate from batch processing)

**Should Fix**: Update clustering function to match logger signature

## Success Criteria (Next 24 Hours)

### Immediate (Next 30 Minutes)
- [ ] iOS app builds without errors
- [ ] Admin dashboard loads without 500 errors
- [ ] Batch Processing section visible
- [ ] First batch submission at 22:00 UTC

### Short Term (By 23:00 UTC)
- [ ] First batch completes successfully
- [ ] batch_tracking container has records
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows batch metrics
- [ ] Success rate > 0%

### 24 Hours  
- [ ] Multiple batches completed (48+ batches)
- [ ] Success rate > 95%
- [ ] Stories getting summaries via batch
- [ ] Daily cost dropping toward $6-7
- [ ] New summaries use `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If batch processing continues to fail:

### 1. Disable Batch Processing
```bash
az functionapp config appsettings set \
  --name newsreel-func-51689 \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --settings BATCH_PROCESSING_ENABLED=false
```

### 2. Re-enable Old Backfill
```bash
az functionapp config appsettings set \
  --name newsreel-func-51689 \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --settings SUMMARIZATION_BACKFILL_ENABLED=true
```

### 3. Revert Model (Last Resort)
Edit `Azure/functions/shared/config.py`:
```python
ANTHROPIC_MODEL: str = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"  # Revert to Sonnet
```

Then redeploy functions.

## Monitoring Commands

### Check Recent Batch Activity
```bash
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-insights \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(2h) and message contains 'Batch' | project timestamp, severityLevel, message | order by timestamp desc"
```

### Check for Errors
```bash
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-insights \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) and severityLevel >= 3 | project timestamp, message | order by timestamp desc | take 20"
```

### Check Function Status
```bash
az functionapp function show \
  --name newsreel-func-51689 \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --function-name BatchSummarizationManager
```
