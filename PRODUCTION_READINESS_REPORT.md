## iOS App Changes Made

### Change 1: Enable Authenticated Feed Endpoint
**File**: `Newsreel App/Newsreel/Services/APIService.swift`

**Before**:
```swift
// TEMPORARY FIX: Use breaking endpoint instead of feed endpoint
var endpoint = "/api/stories/breaking?limit=\(limit)"
let azureStories: [AzureStoryResponse] = try await request(
    endpoint: endpoint, method: "GET", requiresAuth: false
)
```

**After**:
```swift
// Use the proper authenticated feed endpoint
var endpoint = "/api/stories/feed?offset=\(offset)&limit=\(limit)"
let azureStories: [AzureStoryResponse] = try await request(
    endpoint: endpoint, method: "GET", requiresAuth: true
)
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Users get personalized feed based on preferences
- ✅ Proper pagination support
- ✅ Category filtering works
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Error handling and fallbacks intact

   - Status: Expected (cold start)
   - Workaround: None needed
   - Impact: Users experience slight delay first time
   - Fix: Azure Container App warm-up

3. **Initial Summary Generation**

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise in production:

### Issue: API Errors
```bash
# Check API status
az container show --resource-group Newsreel-RG --name newsreel-api

# Restart API
az container restart --resource-group Newsreel-RG --name newsreel-api
```

### Issue: Function App Problems
```bash
# Restart Function App
az functionapp restart --name newsreel-func-51689 --resource-group Newsreel-RG
```

### Issue: Database Issues
```bash
# Check Cosmos DB status
az cosmosdb show --name newsreel-db-1759951135 --resource-group Newsreel-RG
```

### Complete Rollback
Revert to previous iOS app build in App Store while backend is investigated.
