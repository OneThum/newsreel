# üî• Breaking News Testing - Complete Implementation

**Completed**: 2025-10-13 05:42 UTC  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED & READY FOR TESTING**

---

## üéØ What We Built

### **Live Test Suite for Breaking News Detection**

Using the **real Gaza hostage release** (happening right now) as our test case, we've built:

1. ‚úÖ **Extended breaking news duration: 30min ‚Üí 90min**
2. ‚úÖ **Extended active development window: 15min ‚Üí 30min**
3. ‚úÖ **Enhanced logging for real-time debugging**
4. ‚úÖ **Real-time monitoring tools**
5. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive test plan**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Created

### **1. Real-Time Monitor** (`monitor-breaking-news.sh`)

**What it does:**
- Monitors the Gaza hostage story every 30 seconds
- Shows status changes, source additions, transitions
- Auto-detects promotions to BREAKING
- Tracks breaking news monitor activity

**Usage:**
```bash
cd Azure/scripts
./monitor-breaking-news.sh
```

**Output:**
```
üî• LIVE BREAKING NEWS MONITOR - Gaza Hostage Release
====================================================

2025-10-13 05:42:00 UTC

1Ô∏è‚É£ Story Status from Logs:
   ‚úÖ 05:41:23: BREAKING status
   üì∞ 05:41:22: Added reuters source (now 6 total)
   üî• 05:41:22: PROMOTED TO BREAKING!

2Ô∏è‚É£ Recent Clustering Activity (Gaza/Hostage):
   05:41:23: Added reuters to story... (now 6 unique sources)
   05:41:22: ‚úì Fuzzy match: 'Hostages released...'

3Ô∏è‚É£ Breaking News Monitor Activity:
   üîÑ 05:40:00: Breaking news monitor triggered
   üìä 05:40:00: 3 BREAKING stories, no actions needed

Next check in 30 seconds...
```

---

### **2. Quick Status Check** (`check-story-now.sh`)

**What it does:**
- Instant status of any story
- Shows current status, source count, last activity
- Provides recommendations if something is wrong

**Usage:**
```bash
cd Azure/scripts
./check-story-now.sh [story_id]

# For Gaza story:
./check-story-now.sh story_20251012_084423_58f041ad44cd
```

**Output:**
```
üîç Checking Story: story_20251012_084423_58f041ad44cd
================================

Latest activity (last 10 minutes):
  üî• 2m ago: PROMOTED TO BREAKING
  üì∞ 2m ago: Added reuters ‚Üí 6 sources
  üìä 2m ago: updated - [BREAKING] - 6 sources

==================================================
Current Status: BREAKING
Source Count: 6
Last Activity: 2m ago

==================================================
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Story is marked as BREAKING
```

### **3. Test Plan** (`docs/Breaking_News_Test_Plan.md`)

**Comprehensive testing guide including:**
- Test scenarios with expected behavior
- Monitoring commands
- Troubleshooting guide
- Success metrics
- Iteration plan

---

## üîß Configuration Changes

### **Breaking News Duration: 90 Minutes**

**Why:**
- Major breaking news develops over hours, not just 30 minutes
- Gaza hostage release: updates coming every 15-30 minutes for 2-3 hours
- Elections: results come in over 6+ hours
- Disasters: updates for hours

**How it works:**
```python
# Story stays BREAKING until 90 minutes of NO UPDATES
if time_since_update >= timedelta(minutes=90):
    status = BREAKING ‚Üí VERIFIED
```

**Example:**
```
05:00 - Story gets update ‚Üí BREAKING
05:30 - Another update ‚Üí Still BREAKING (last update 0m ago)
06:00 - Another update ‚Üí Still BREAKING (last update 0m ago)
06:30 - No more updates
08:00 - 90 min passed ‚Üí VERIFIED (no updates for 90m)
```

---

### **Active Development Window: 30 Minutes**

**Why:**
- Some sources are slower to report
- Gives time for all major sources to add their article
- Catches stories that are developing more slowly

**How it works:**
```python
# If story gained source in last 30 minutes ‚Üí BREAKING
if is_gaining_sources and time_since_update < timedelta(minutes=30):
    status = VERIFIED ‚Üí BREAKING
```

**Example:**
```
Day 1, 08:00 - Story created: "Gaza ceasefire" - 3 sources ‚Üí VERIFIED
Day 2, 05:30 - HOSTAGES RELEASED! Reuters adds article
                last_update: 0 minutes ago
                is_gaining_sources: True
                ‚Üí BREAKING! üî•
```

---

### **Enhanced Logging**

**What we added:**
```python
logger.info(
    f"üìä Status evaluation: sources={4}‚Üí{5}, "
    f"age={1440}m, last_update={0}m ago, "
    f"current_status=VERIFIED, is_gaining=True"
)
logger.info("üî• Story promoted to BREAKING (actively developing)")
```

**Why it matters:**
- See exactly why a story got BREAKING status
- Debug issues in real-time
- Understand decision factors
- Track story lifecycle

## üéØ How to Test Right Now

### **Step 1: Start Real-Time Monitor**

```bash
cd "/Users/davemac/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-OneThumSoftware/One Thum Software/Newsreel/Azure/scripts"

# Start continuous monitoring
./monitor-breaking-news.sh
```

Leave this running in a terminal. It will update every 30 seconds.

---

### **Step 2: Check Current Status**

In another terminal:
```bash
cd "/Users/davemac/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-OneThumSoftware/One Thum Software/Newsreel/Azure/scripts"

# Check Gaza story status
./check-story-now.sh story_20251012_084423_58f041ad44cd
```

---

### **Step 3: Watch Your iOS App**

1. Open Newsreel app
2. Pull to refresh
3. Look for Gaza hostage story
4. Check if it has üö® BREAKING badge
5. Check if it's at or near the top

---

### **Step 4: Wait for Next Update**

The hostage release is happening RIGHT NOW. Expect:
- New articles every 15-30 minutes
- Story status updates in real-time
- Promotions to BREAKING as they happen

---

## üìà What to Look For

### **‚úÖ Success Indicators:**

1. **In Logs:**
   - "üî• Story promoted to BREAKING"
   - "üì∞ Added [source] ‚Üí X sources"
   - "üìä Status evaluation: ... is_gaining=True"

2. **In Monitoring Script:**
   - "‚úÖ BREAKING status"
   - "üì∞ Added reuters source (now 6 total)"
   - Source count increasing over time

3. **In iOS App:**
   - Gaza story at or near top of feed
   - üö® BREAKING badge visible
   - "Updated Xm ago" timestamp
   - Multiple sources listed

---

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs:**

1. **Story stuck at VERIFIED:**
   - Has 5+ sources
   - Being updated
   - But status not changing to BREAKING

2. **Story not visible:**
   - Not in top 10 stories
   - Buried on page 2-3
   - `last_updated` not changing

3. **No logging:**
   - No "Status evaluation" messages
   - No "Added source" messages
   - Function may not be running

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **If story not BREAKING:**

**Check 1: Is it gaining sources?**
```bash
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(30m) | where message contains 'story_20251012_084423_58f041ad44cd' and message contains 'Added' | project timestamp, message | order by timestamp desc"
```

**Check 2: Are status evaluations running?**
```bash
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(10m) | where message contains 'Status evaluation' | project timestamp, message | order by timestamp desc | take 10"
```

**Check 3: Is clustering working?**
```bash
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(30m) | where message contains 'israel' or message contains 'hostage' or message contains 'gaza' | where message contains 'Fuzzy match' or message contains 'Added' | project timestamp, message | order by timestamp desc | take 10"
```
