   - This story created: 04:52 UTC
   - Has old article IDs (with timestamps)
   - 22 article IDs likely include duplicates from same sources

3. **Breaking news engine IS working** ✓
   - Logs show: `is_gaining=True`
   - Correctly detecting active development
   - Promoting to BREAKING status

## 🤔 WHY USER SEES "22 SAME SOURCES"

### **Theory 1: Old Article IDs**

Story has mix of old (timestamped) and potentially new (URL-based) article IDs:

**Example**:
```
ap_20251013_045630_abc123  ← Old format (before fix)
ap_20251013_060000_abc123  ← Old format (update 1)
ap_20251013_070000_abc123  ← Old format (update 2)
bbc_20251013_050000_def456 ← Old format
...
```

**API deduplication** (deployed 09:16 UTC):
- Should deduplicate these by source name
- ap_xxx, ap_xxx, ap_xxx → 1 "Associated Press" entry
- bbc_xxx → 1 "BBC" entry

**But**: API might not be working correctly, or iOS is showing cached data.

---

### **Theory 2: Legitimate Multi-Source Story**

Story legitimately has 22 different sources:
- AP, BBC, Reuters, CNN, Guardian, etc.
- All covering same Russia/Ukraine event
- Headlines might look similar (same event)
- **User perception**: "All look the same"

**This would be expected** for major breaking news!

---

### **Theory 3: API Deduplication Not Applied**

The API deduplication code is in place, but:
- Container might not have restarted properly
- Code might have a bug
- iOS showing cached response from before deployment

---

## 🧪 HOW TO DETERMINE WHICH THEORY IS CORRECT

### **User Action Required**:

Open the story and check the "Multiple Perspectives" section:

1. **Count the entries** - Are there actually 22 separate entries?

2. **Read the source names** - Are they:
   - ✅ All "Associated Press" → API deduplication not working
   - ✅ Different sources (AP, BBC, CNN, etc.) → Legitimate multi-source story

3. **Tap on 3-5 different entries** - Do they go to:
   - ✅ Same URL → Duplicates (bug)
   - ✅ Different URLs → Different articles (expected for breaking news)

---

## ⏰ WHAT ABOUT NEW STORIES?

The fix will work correctly for stories created **after 09:45 UTC**.

### **Look for stories with timestamps > 09:45 UTC**:

In your feed, find a story that:
- Shows "First seen: X minutes ago" where X < 90 minutes
- Has multiple sources
- Check if sources are deduplicated correctly

**These should show**:
- 1 entry per unique source ✓
- No duplicates ✓

---

## 📝 SUMMARY OF TODAY'S FIXES

**Evidence**: Russia story correctly promoted to BREAKING

### **Fix 2: API Deduplication** ⚠️ UNCLEAR
**Deployed**: 09:16 UTC  
**Status**: ? Need user verification  
**Test**: Check if old story shows duplicates

### **Fix 3: Update-in-Place** ✅ DEPLOYED
**Deployed**: 09:45 UTC  
**Status**: ✓ Active for new stories  
**Test**: Check stories created after 09:45 UTC

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### **1. User: Check the Russia Story Sources**

Open the story and tell me:
- How many unique source names do you see? (AP, BBC, CNN, etc.)
- Are they all the same name or different names?
- Do different entries go to different URLs?

### **2. User: Find a NEW Story**

Look for a story created in last 60 minutes:
- Check if sources are deduplicated
- Each source should appear once

### **3. Wait 30-60 Minutes**

For full effect of update-in-place fix:
- New articles will use new ID format
- Database will gradually clean up
- Old stories will have mix of old/new IDs

## 💡 MY HYPOTHESIS

**Most likely**: This is a **legitimate multi-source breaking news story** with 22 different news outlets covering the Russia/Ukraine conflict.

**User perception**: Headlines look similar because they're all about the same event.

**Expected**: Major breaking news should have many sources!

**To confirm**: User needs to check if source names are actually different (AP, BBC, CNN, Reuters, Guardian, etc.) or if they're all "Associated Press" 22 times.

---

## 🚀 IF IT'S STILL BROKEN

If user confirms all 22 entries show "Associated Press" (same source):

Then the API deduplication isn't working, and we need to:
1. Verify API container actually restarted with new code
2. Check for bugs in deduplication logic
3. Possibly rebuild/redeploy API
