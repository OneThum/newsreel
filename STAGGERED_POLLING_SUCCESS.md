## 🚨 Breaking News Detection

With continuous polling + multi-source clustering:

**Story Lifecycle:**
1. **00:00** - Breaking news happens (e.g., Israel hostage release)
2. **00:30** - First article ingested (BBC, AP, or Reuters)
3. **01:00** - Second source adds article → Story gets 2 sources → **Status: DEVELOPING**
4. **02:00** - Third source → Story gets 3 sources → **Status: BREAKING**
5. **02:01** - Push notification sent to all users
6. **30:00** - Story is 30 min old → **Status transitions to VERIFIED**

**Current System:**
- ✅ Continuous polling working
- ✅ Articles flowing in steadily
- ⏳ Clustering needs time to match articles
- ⏳ Breaking news detection once multi-source stories form

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 15 minutes):
1. ✅ Monitor for Israel breaking news stories
2. ✅ Check if multi-source stories are forming
3. ✅ Verify BREAKING status is assigned correctly
4. ✅ Confirm push notifications trigger (once stories hit BREAKING)

### Short Term (1-2 hours):
1. ✅ Verify feed diversity continues to improve
2. ✅ Check clustering precision (no false merges)
3. ✅ Monitor summarization quality
4. ✅ Confirm breaking news workflow end-to-end

### Medium Term (24 hours):
1. ✅ Analyze user engagement metrics
2. ✅ Check retention/session time
3. ✅ Verify push notification delivery
4. ✅ Compare before/after user satisfaction

## 💡 Why This Is Critical for Breaking News

### The Israel Hostage Release Example:

**With Old System (5-min burst pattern):**
```
12:00 - BBC publishes: "Israel hostage released"
12:03 - [SILENCE - waiting for next batch]
12:05 - Batch runs, BBC article ingested
12:08 - [SILENCE - waiting for next batch]
12:10 - Batch runs, CNN article ingested
Result: 10 minutes to get 2 sources, no BREAKING status
```

**With New System (continuous 10s polling, 3-min rotation):**
```
12:00 - BBC publishes: "Israel hostage released"
12:00:30 - BBC polled, article ingested → Story created (1 source)
12:01:00 - CNN polled, article ingested → Clustered with BBC (2 sources → DEVELOPING)
12:01:30 - AP polled, article ingested → Clustered (3 sources → BREAKING 🚨)
12:01:31 - Push notification sent to all users
Result: 90 seconds to get 3 sources and BREAKING status!
```

**Impact:** 
- ⚡ **8.5 minutes faster** detection
- 🚨 **Immediate user notification**
- 📱 **Users see breaking news as it happens**
