# Active Debug Session 4: Clustering Fix Attempt & Issue Identified

## Status
- ✅ Fixed `article.url` → `article.article_url` error (2 occurrences)
- ✅ Improved error logging with traceback
- ✅ Removed duplicate function modules (story_clustering, rss_ingestion, summarization, breaking_news_monitor)
- ❌ Clustering function still not creating story documents
- ⚠️ Change feed trigger appears not to be firing properly

## What Was Accomplished
1. ✅ Identified attribute error: clustering function accessing `article.url` instead of `article.article_url`
2. ✅ Fixed both occurrences in function_app.py (lines 942, 1107)
3. ✅ Added detailed logging to understand article processing
4. ✅ Discovered duplicate function definitions in separate modules (story_clustering/, rss_ingestion/, summarization/)
5. ✅ Consolidated all functions into main function_app.py
6. ✅ Deployed consolidated version

## Current State
- Raw articles: 3,285+ (RSS ingestion working ✅)
- Story clusters: 0 (clustering NOT working ❌)
- Function App: Deployed and running
- Lease containers: Exist (leases, leases-summarization)

## Root Cause Analysis
The change feed trigger for `StoryClusteringChangeFeed` is **NOT firing** even after fixes. Possible causes:

1. **Trigger not initializing properly**: Change feed requires lease checkpoint. May need explicit trigger reinitialization
2. **Lease offset issue**: The lease might be pointing to future timestamp, skipping all existing articles
3. **Cosmos DB connection issue**: Change feed trigger may not be connecting to container properly
4. **Function deployment issue**: Consolidation may have affected function discovery

## Evidence
- RSS Ingestion runs every 10 seconds (working) ✅
- Application Insights shows RSSIngestion function execution
- Application Insights does NOT show StoryClusteringChangeFeed execution (or minimal)
- No error messages in logs
- No "Processing article" debug logs appear

## Next Steps to Try
1. **Delete lease containers** to force full re-initialization
2. **Check Azure Function Runtime Logs** via Azure Portal
3. **Manually trigger clustering** by updating articles with different partition key
4. **Verify change feed is enabled** on raw_articles container
5. **Check function code** is actually deployed (verify in Portal runtime)

## Critical Files Modified
- `Azure/functions/function_app.py`: Fixed article.url errors, added debug logging
- Deleted: story_clustering/, rss_ingestion/, summarization/, breaking_news_monitor/ modules

## Hypothesis
The change feed trigger may not be properly initialized due to lease checkpoints. Deleting and recreating lease containers could force a fresh start and process all existing articles.

## Status: ⏳ Investigating Change Feed Trigger
Infrastructure is fixed, but trigger mechanism appears blocked. Need to verify change feed configuration.
