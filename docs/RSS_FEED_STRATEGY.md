## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Phase 1: MVP (CURRENT - 10 Feeds)

**Active Now**:
```
Reuters World, BBC World, AP World, TechCrunch, The Verge,
Science Daily, Reuters Business, ESPN, NPR, CNN
```

**Purpose**:
- Test the system with manageable volume
- Verify RSS ingestion works
- Validate story clustering
- Test AI summarization
- Monitor costs
- Ensure stability

**Expected Volume**:
- Articles: ~200/hour (50-100 new after deduplication)
- Stories: ~40/hour (20-30 new clusters)
- Cost: ~$5/month for ingestion

### Phase 2: Full Production (100 Feeds)

**Activation**:
Set environment variable:
```bash
az functionapp config appsettings set \
  --name newsreel-func-51689 \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --settings "RSS_USE_ALL_FEEDS=true"
```

**Expected Volume**:
- Articles: ~2,000/hour (500-1,000 new after deduplication)
- Stories: ~300/hour (150-200 new clusters)
- Cost: ~$15/month for ingestion (still under budget!)

**When to Activate**:
- After MVP testing successful
- After cost monitoring established
- After story clustering verified
- When ready for full production scale

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION

### Code Location

**File**: `Azure/functions/shared/rss_feeds.py`

**Functions**:
```python
get_all_feeds()              # Returns all 100 feeds
get_initial_feeds()          # Returns initial 10 feeds (MVP)
get_feeds_by_category(cat)   # Filter by category
get_feeds_by_tier(tier)      # Filter by tier
get_feeds_by_region(region)  # Filter by region
```

### Configuration

**Current Mode**: MVP (10 feeds)

**Switch to Full Mode**:
```bash
az functionapp config appsettings set \
  --name newsreel-func-51689 \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --settings "RSS_USE_ALL_FEEDS=true"
```

**Switch Back to MVP**:
```bash
az functionapp config appsettings set \
  --name newsreel-func-51689 \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --settings "RSS_USE_ALL_FEEDS=false"
```

## 📈 PERFORMANCE & COST IMPLICATIONS

### MVP Mode (10 Feeds - Current)

**Volume**:
- Articles: ~200/hour (~50 new)
- Stories: ~40/hour (~20 new)
- Summaries: ~30/hour (~15 new)

**Performance**:
- RSS Ingestion: 30-60 seconds
- Concurrent: 10 feeds / 20 max = 1-2 batches
- Success Rate: >90%

**Cost**:
- Function Executions: ~288/day = ~$2/month
- Cosmos DB writes: ~1,200 articles/day = ~$3/month
- **Total for RSS**: ~$5/month

### Full Production (100 Feeds)

**Volume**:
- Articles: ~2,000/hour (~500-1,000 new)
- Stories: ~300/hour (~150-200 new)
- Summaries: ~200/hour (~100-150 new)

**Performance**:
- RSS Ingestion: 90-120 seconds (with 25 concurrent)
- Concurrent: 100 feeds / 25 max = 4 batches
- Success Rate: >85% (some feeds may be slow/unavailable)

**Cost Estimate**:
- Function Executions: ~288/day (same) = ~$2/month
- Cosmos DB writes: ~12,000 articles/day = ~$10/month
- Claude API (summaries): ~3,000 summaries/day = ~$15-18/month
- **Total for RSS + Summarization**: ~$27-30/month

**Still well under budget!** ✅

## 🎨 FEED DIVERSITY STRATEGY

### Geographic Coverage

**Global Coverage** (40 feeds):
- Ensures worldwide event detection
- Multiple perspectives on same events
- Breaking news from any region

**Regional Focus**:
- US: 20 feeds (domestic emphasis)
- Europe: 25 feeds (EU perspective)
- Asia-Pacific: 15 feeds (growing importance)

### Topical Coverage

**Hard News** (55 feeds):
- World, US, Europe, Australia
- Authoritative sources
- Breaking news capable

**Specialized** (45 feeds):
- Technology (15) - innovation coverage
- Business (10) - economic news
- Science/Health (10) - research/health
- Sports (10) - major events

### Source Diversity

**Wire Services** (8 Tier 1):
- Reuters (5 feeds)
- AP (1 feed)
- NASA (1 feed)
- Reuters Sports (1 feed)

**Major Outlets** (92 Tier 2):
- Broadcast networks (CNN, BBC, NBC, etc.)
- National newspapers (NYT, Guardian, etc.)
- Tech publications (TechCrunch, Wired, etc.)
- Financial press (Bloomberg, WSJ, etc.)
- Science journals (Nature, Scientific American, etc.)

---

## 🔄 POLLING STRATEGY

### Tier 1 Feeds (5-minute polling)

**Feeds**: 8 wire services  
**Schedule**: Every 5 minutes  
**Reason**: Breaking news, authoritative, fast-moving

**Sources**:
- Reuters (world, top, business, sports, africa, asia)
- AP (world)
- NASA (space/science breaking news)

### Tier 2 Feeds (10-15 minute polling)

**Feeds**: 92 major outlets  
**Schedule**: Every 5 minutes (same for simplicity)  
**Reason**: Less time-critical, reduces load

**Note**: Currently all feeds poll every 5 minutes. Can optimize later by:
```python
# In feed config
"poll_interval": 300,  # Tier 1: 5 minutes
"poll_interval": 600,  # Tier 2: 10 minutes  
"poll_interval": 900,  # Tier 2: 15 minutes
```

## 🌍 MULTI-SOURCE VERIFICATION EXAMPLES

### How 100 Feeds Enable Better Verification

**Event**: Major earthquake in Japan

**Potential Sources** (from our 100 feeds):
1. Reuters Asia (Tier 1)
2. Reuters World (Tier 1)
3. Reuters Top (Tier 1)
4. BBC World
5. AP World
6. Guardian World
7. Japan Times
8. SCMP
9. CNN
10. NPR

**Result**: 
- Story gets 10 sources
- High verification level
- Marked as VERIFIED/BREAKING
- High confidence for users
- Multiple perspectives synthesized

**vs. MVP (10 feeds)**:
- Maybe 2-3 sources
- Lower verification
- Less comprehensive

**100 feeds = Better verification = More trustworthy news** ✅

## 💰 COST ANALYSIS

### Current (MVP - 10 Feeds)

| Cost Component | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| Function executions (RSS) | $2/mo |
| Cosmos DB writes | $3/mo |
| Bandwidth | <$1/mo |
| **Total** | **~$5/mo** |

### Full Production (100 Feeds)

| Cost Component | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| Function executions (RSS) | $2/mo (same frequency) |
| Cosmos DB writes | $10/mo (10x articles) |
| Claude API (summaries) | $15-18/mo (10x stories) |
| Bandwidth | $2/mo |
| **Total** | **~$29-32/mo** |

**Budget Impact**:
- Current total: $77-87/month
- With 100 feeds: $101-109/month
- Budget: $150/month
- **Still $41-49/month under budget!** ✅

---

## 🚀 ACTIVATION PROCEDURE

### To Activate All 100 Feeds

**Step 1: Verify MVP is Stable** (1-2 days)
```bash
# Check logs
az functionapp log tail --name newsreel-func-51689 --resource-group Newsreel-RG

# Look for:
# - "RSS ingestion complete: X new articles"
# - Success rate >90%
# - No errors
```

**Step 2: Monitor Current Costs** (1 day)
```bash
# Ensure current costs are as expected
# Should be ~$3-5/day
```

**Step 3: Activate 100 Feeds**
```bash
az functionapp config appsettings set \
  --name newsreel-func-51689 \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --settings "RSS_USE_ALL_FEEDS=true"
```

**Step 4: Monitor First Full Run** (10 minutes)
```bash
# Watch for increased volume
cd Azure/scripts
./monitor-first-run.sh

# Should see:
# - "Loading ALL 100 RSS feeds (Full Production Mode)"
# - "Fetched X of 100 feeds successfully"
# - "RSS ingestion complete: 500-1000 new articles"
```

**Step 5: Monitor Performance** (24 hours)
- Check execution times (<2 minutes for all 100)
- Monitor Cosmos DB RU consumption
- Verify story clustering handling volume
- Check Claude API costs

**Step 6: Adjust if Needed**
```bash
# If needed, can increase concurrency
az functionapp config appsettings set \
  --name newsreel-func-51689 \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --settings "RSS_MAX_CONCURRENT=30"  # Increase from 25
```

## 📝 FEED MAINTENANCE

### Adding New Feeds

**1. Add to rss_feeds.py**:
```python
RSSFeedConfig(
    id="new_source",
    name="New Source Name",
    url="https://newsource.com/rss",
    source_id="newsource",
    category="world",
    tier=2,
    language="en",
    country="US"
)
```

**2. Test Locally** (optional):
```python
# Test single feed
feed = RSSFeedConfig(...)
result = await fetcher.fetch_feed(feed)
```

**3. Deploy**:
```bash
cd Azure/functions
func azure functionapp publish newsreel-func-51689
```

**4. Monitor**:
```bash
# Check logs for new feed
az functionapp log tail --name newsreel-func-51689 --resource-group Newsreel-RG
```

### Removing Feeds

**1. Comment out in rss_feeds.py**:
```python
# RSSFeedConfig(...)  # Disabled: feed no longer available
```

**2. Deploy**:
```bash
func azure functionapp publish newsreel-func-51689
```

### Updating Feed URLs

RSS feeds sometimes change URLs. Update in `rss_feeds.py` and redeploy.

---

## 🔍 FEED VALIDATION

### Pre-Deployment Checks

Before adding to production:

1. **URL is accessible**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://feed-url.com/rss
   # Should return 200 OK
   ```

2. **Returns valid RSS/Atom**
   ```bash
   curl https://feed-url.com/rss | head -50
   # Should show XML with <rss> or <feed> tags
   ```

3. **Has recent articles**
   - Check publication dates
   - Should have articles from last 24 hours

4. **Reasonable volume**
   - Not too many (>100/fetch = spam)
   - Not too few (<5/fetch = inactive)

5. **English language**
   - All feeds should be English or have English versions
