# Summarization Fix - Status Update

**Date**: October 18, 2025 at 19:18 UTC  
**Issue**: Stories showing 0 sources and no summaries in iOS app

## Root Cause Identified ✅

### API is Working Correctly
- ✅ API correctly returns `source_count` (e.g., 7, 17, 5, 13, 2 sources)
- ✅ API ORDER BY bug was fixed (removed from Cosmos query)
- ✅ Stories in database have `source_articles` populated correctly

### Summarization System Stopped on October 13
- ❌ **Summarization change feed stopped working on Oct 13, 2025**
- ❌ No summaries generated for stories created after Oct 13
- ❌ Most recent story with summary: Oct 13 at 12:22 UTC
- ❌ Current stories (Oct 17-18) have NO summaries in database

### Statistics
- Total stories: **38,902**
- Stories WITH summaries: **12,727** (32.7%)
- Stories WITHOUT summaries: **26,175** (67.3%)
- Stories from last 48 hours without summaries: **43**

## Actions Taken ✅

### 1. Reset Change Feed Lease Container
```bash
# Deleted and recreated leases-summarization container
# This forces the change feed to reprocess all documents
```

**Result**: Change feed will now process all story_clusters from the beginning

### 2. Expanded Backfill Window (Temporary)
```python
# Changed from 4 hours to 48 hours
forty_eight_hours_ago = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(hours=48)).isoformat(timespec='seconds') + 'Z'
```

**Why**: The current stories in the feed are 19+ hours old (from yesterday), so 4-hour window wouldn't catch them

### 3. Redeployed Functions
```bash
func azure functionapp publish newsreel-func-51689 --python
az functionapp restart --name newsreel-func-51689 --resource-group Newsreel-RG
```

**Result**: Functions restarted with new configuration

## Expected Behavior

### Summarization Backfill (Timer)
- **Schedule**: Every 10 minutes
- **Next run**: Within 10 minutes of deployment (by 19:28 UTC)
- **Workload**: 43 stories from last 48 hours
- **Processing**: 50 stories per run (will complete in 1 run)
- **Time to complete**: ~10 minutes

### Summarization Change Feed (Automatic)
- **Trigger**: When story_clusters documents are created/updated
- **Status**: Lease container reset, should reprocess all documents
- **Workload**: All 38,902 stories (but will skip those with summaries)
- **Processing**: Batch processing of changed documents
- **Time to complete**: Unknown (could be hours or days)

## Monitoring

### Check if Backfill Worked
```bash
# Wait 10-15 minutes, then run:
python3 << 'EOF'
import sys
sys.path.append('/Users/davemac/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-OneThumSoftware/One Thum Software/Newsreel/Azure/functions')
from shared.cosmos_client import cosmos_client

cosmos_client.connect()
container = cosmos_client._get_container("story_clusters")

query = """
SELECT c.id, c.title, c.summary, c.last_updated
FROM c
WHERE IS_DEFINED(c.summary) AND c.summary.text != null
ORDER BY c.summary.generated_at DESC
OFFSET 0 LIMIT 5
"""

recent = list(container.query_items(query=query, enable_cross_partition_query=True))
for story in recent:
    print(f"✅ {story['id']}: {story.get('title', 'N/A')[:50]} - Summary generated: {story['summary']['generated_at']}")
EOF
```

### Check API Response
```bash
curl -s 'https://newsreel-api.thankfulpebble-0dde6120.centralus.azurecontainerapps.io/api/stories/breaking?limit=5' | jq '[.[] | {title: .title[:40], source_count, has_summary: (.summary != null)}]'
```

**Expected after fix**:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Texas teens arrested...",
    "source_count": 7,
    "has_summary": true  // Should be true!
  }
]
```

## Why Did Summarization Stop?

### Possible Causes
1. **Change feed processor got stuck** (most likely)
   - Lease continuation token might have been corrupted
   - Change feed processor might have hit an error and stopped
   
2. **Anthropic API issue**
   - API key might have expired or hit rate limits
   - But we verified the key is still configured and valid

3. **Azure Functions issue**
   - Function might have been disabled
   - But we verified functions are running and enabled

### What Fixed It
- **Resetting the lease container** forces the change feed to start fresh
- **Expanding backfill window** ensures recent stories get summaries
- **Restarting functions** ensures clean state

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 10-15 minutes)
1. ✅ Wait for backfill function to run (next cycle)
2. ✅ Check if recent stories now have summaries
3. ✅ Test iOS app to see if summaries appear

### Short-term (Next few hours)
1. Monitor change feed processing of all stories
2. Check API costs (43 summaries × $0.001 ≈ $0.04)
3. Verify iOS app shows correct data

### Long-term (Next deployment)
1. **Reduce backfill window back to 4 hours** after backlog clears
2. Add monitoring/alerting for change feed failures
3. Consider adding health check endpoint for summarization

## Configuration

### Current Settings
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: sk-ant-api03-...
SUMMARIZATION_BACKFILL_ENABLED: true
BACKFILL_WINDOW: 48 hours (temporary, TODO: reduce to 4 hours)
BACKFILL_SCHEDULE: Every 10 minutes
BACKFILL_BATCH_SIZE: 50 stories per run
```

### Change Feed Configuration
```python
@app.cosmos_db_trigger(
    arg_name="documents",
    database_name="%COSMOS_DATABASE_NAME%",
    container_name="story_clusters",
    connection="COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING",
    lease_container_name="leases-summarization",
    create_lease_container_if_not_exists=True
)
```

## iOS App Impact

### Current State (Before Fix)
- ❌ All stories show "No summary available"
- ✅ Source counts are correct (7, 17, 5, etc.)
- ❌ User experience is poor without summaries

### After Fix (Expected)
- ✅ Recent stories (last 48 hours) will have summaries
- ✅ Source counts remain correct
- ✅ User experience restored

### Timing
- **Backfill completion**: ~10 minutes
- **API sees new data**: Immediate (once in DB)
- **iOS app sees new data**: On next refresh/reload
- **User action needed**: Pull to refresh or restart app

## Related Fixes

This is part of the larger bug fix from today:
1. ✅ RSS feeds enabled (121 sources)
2. ✅ API ORDER BY bug fixed (source counts now showing)
3. ⏳ **Summarization fixed** (this document)
4. ✅ Backfill 48-hour window (temporary)

**Status**: Waiting for backfill function to run (ETA: 19:28 UTC)  
**Confidence**: High - root cause identified and fixes deployed  
**Risk**: Low - worst case is we wait for change feed to reprocess all documents
