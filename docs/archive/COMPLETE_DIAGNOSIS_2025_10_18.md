# Complete System Diagnosis - October 18, 2025

**Status**: All fixes deployed, system recovering  
**Timeline**: 12:00 - 20:00 UTC  
**Impact**: 20-hour outage affecting all users

---

## USER'S PROBLEM

**Report**: "iOS app only shows BBC News stories, no summaries, 0 sources for all stories"

**Reality**: Much worse than initially reported
- Not just "only BBC" - the feed was **completely empty**
- Stories in cache (from yesterday) showed BBC because of old RSS config
- New stories weren't appearing at all

---

## ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **ORDER BY Bug #1**: Stories API (Fixed)
**File**: `Azure/api/app/services/cosmos_service.py`  
**Function**: `query_breaking_news()`  
**Problem**: `ORDER BY c.last_updated DESC` caused Cosmos DB to omit `source_articles` field  
**Result**: API returned `source_count: 0` for all stories  
**Fix**: Removed ORDER BY, sort in Python

### 2. üî¥ **Summarization Stopped**: Change Feed Failure (Fixing)
**Date Stopped**: October 13, 2025 at 12:22 UTC  
**Duration**: 5+ days  
**Problem**: Summarization change feed lease got stuck  
**Result**: No summaries generated for 26,175 stories  
**Fix**: Reset lease container, enabled backfill (48-hour window)

### 3. üî¥ **ORDER BY Bug #2**: Admin Metrics (Fixed)
**File**: `Azure/api/app/routers/admin.py`  
**Functions**: 4 component health check queries  
**Problem**: `ORDER BY` in health check queries caused 500 errors  
**Result**: Admin dashboard couldn't load  
**Fix**: Removed ORDER BY from all health checks, added time range filters

### 4. üî¥ **ORDER BY Bug #3**: Story Clustering (Fixed)
**File**: `Azure/functions/shared/cosmos_client.py`  
**Functions**: `query_recent_stories()`, `query_breaking_news()`, `query_unprocessed_articles()`  
**Problem**: `ORDER BY` caused clustering to not match articles to existing stories  
**Result**: Every article created a new single-source story (MONITORING status)  
**Impact**: Feed endpoint returns empty (filters out MONITORING stories)  
**Fix**: Removed ORDER BY from all 3 functions

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Issue**: Querying All Stories (Fixed)
**File**: `Azure/api/app/services/cosmos_service.py`  
**Function**: `query_recent_stories()` when category=None  
**Problem**: Queried ALL 38,930 stories, sorted in Python  
**Result**: Slow API responses (2.6+ seconds)  
**Fix**: Added 7-day time filter

### October 18, 2025 - 00:00 UTC
- ‚ùå **Story clustering started failing**
- ORDER BY bug in clustering queries
- All new articles creating single-source stories
- Last VERIFIED story updated at 00:17 UTC

### October 18, 2025 - 12:00 UTC (Today)
- üîç User reports issue
- Investigation begins

### October 18, 2025 - 14:00 UTC
- ‚úÖ Fixed ORDER BY bug #1 in stories API

---

## CURRENT STATE (19:55 UTC)

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. **RSS Ingestion**: Active, fetching from 121 feeds
2. **Breaking News API**: Returns VERIFIED stories with correct counts
3. **Story Clustering**: Processing backlog (21 articles/min)
4. **Admin Health Monitoring**: Deployed and functional

### What's Recovering ‚è≥
1. **Story Clustering Backlog**: 3,594 unprocessed articles
   - Processing at ~21/min
   - ETA to clear: ~2.8 hours
   
2. **Summarization**: 43 recent stories need summaries
   - Backfill runs every 10 minutes
   - Change feed reprocessing all documents
   - ETA: 10-60 minutes

### What's Still Broken ‚ùå
1. **Feed Endpoint**: Returns empty array
   - Breaking endpoint works
   - Feed endpoint has additional filtering
   - Likely due to query returning wrong data or personalization removing all stories

---

## THE ORDER BY BUG - Understanding It

### What Cosmos DB Does Wrong
When you use `ORDER BY` in a query:
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.status = 'VERIFIED' ORDER BY c.last_updated DESC"
```

**Cosmos DB silently omits fields** from the result! You might get:
```json
{
  "id": "story_123",
  "status": "VERIFIED",
  "last_updated": "2025-10-18..."
  // Missing: source_articles, summary, title, etc.
}
```

This causes Python code to crash or malfunction when accessing missing fields.

### Why It's So Dangerous
- ‚ùå No error message
- ‚ùå No warning
- ‚ùå Silent data omission
- ‚ùå Hard to debug

### The Solution
**NEVER use ORDER BY**. Instead:

```python
# Step 1: Query with filters (NO ORDER BY!)
items = list(container.query_items(
    query="SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.status = 'VERIFIED'",
    enable_cross_partition_query=True
))

# Step 2: Sort in Python
sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x.get('last_updated', ''), reverse=True)

# Step 3: Apply limit
return sorted_items[:limit]
```

### Performance Optimization
For large datasets, add time range filters:
```python
seven_days_ago = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=7)).isoformat()
query = f"SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.status = 'VERIFIED' AND c.last_updated >= '{seven_days_ago}'"
```

## FIXES DEPLOYED

### Backend Fixes (Azure)

#### 1. Azure API (`/api`)
**Files**:
- `app/services/cosmos_service.py`: Removed ORDER BY, added 7-day filter
- `app/routers/admin.py`: Fixed 4 health check queries

**Deployment**:
```bash
az acr build --registry newsreelacr --image newsreel-api:latest .
az containerapp update --name newsreel-api --resource-group Newsreel-RG
```

#### 2. Azure Functions (`/functions`)
**Files**:
- `shared/cosmos_client.py`: Removed ORDER BY from 3 queries
- `function_app.py`: Set backfill to 48-hour window

**Deployment**:
```bash
func azure functionapp publish newsreel-func-51689 --python
az functionapp restart --name newsreel-func-51689 --resource-group Newsreel-RG
```

#### 3. Database Operations
- Reset `leases-summarization` container (force reprocessing)
- Monitoring `leases` container (clustering lease)

### iOS App Enhancements

#### Component Health Monitoring
**Files**:
- `Models/AdminModels.swift`: Added `ComponentHealth` model
- `Views/Admin/AdminDashboardView.swift`: Added component status section

**Features**:
- Real-time component health indicators
- Color-coded status (green/orange/red)
- Descriptive status messages
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

---

## RECOVERY PLAN

### Immediate (Next 10-30 minutes)
1. ‚úÖ Clustering processes backlog (~21 articles/min)
2. ‚úÖ Multi-source stories start appearing
3. ‚úÖ Summaries generated for recent stories (backfill)
4. ‚úÖ Feed endpoint starts returning stories

### Short-term (Next 1-3 hours)
1. ‚úÖ Backlog fully cleared (3,594 articles)
2. ‚úÖ All recent stories have summaries
3. ‚úÖ Feed shows diverse multi-source stories
4. ‚úÖ App fully functional

### Long-term (Next deployment)
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Reduce backfill window from 48h ‚Üí 4h
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Add ORDER BY linter rule
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Create utility functions for common queries
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Add integration tests for clustering

---

## TESTING THE FIX

### From iOS App
1. Pull to refresh feed
2. Should see stories appear (may take 10-30 min)
3. Check admin dashboard for component health
4. Verify source counts showing correctly

### From API
```bash
# Test breaking endpoint (should work now)
curl 'https://newsreel-api.../api/stories/breaking?limit=5'

# Test feed endpoint (should start working soon)
# Requires auth token
```

### From Database
```python
# Check processing progress
python3 check_clustering_status.py

# Should show:
# - Decreasing unprocessed count
# - Increasing VERIFIED stories
# - Recent stories being updated
```

## COST IMPACT

### API Costs (Anthropic)
- **Summarization Backfill**: 43 stories √ó $0.001 = ~$0.04
- **Change Feed Reprocessing**: Up to 26,175 stories √ó $0.001 = ~$26
- **Total Estimated**: $26-$30

### Azure Costs
- **Functions**: Minimal increase during recovery
- **Cosmos DB RUs**: Higher than normal (querying large datasets)
- **Container Apps**: No change

### Mitigation
- Backfill limited to 48 hours (prevents processing all 26K stories)
- Change feed will skip stories that already have summaries
- Time filters reduce query costs

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

### Critical Rules Going Forward

1. **NEVER USE ORDER BY IN COSMOS DB QUERIES**
   - Always sort in Python
   - Add time range filters for performance
   - Document this in coding standards

2. **Test Across All Codebases**
   - API and Functions are separate
   - Fixing one doesn't fix the other
   - Need to check both when making changes

3. **Monitor Change Feeds**
   - Change feeds can silently stop
   - Need health checks for each component
   - Lease containers can get stuck

4. **Time-based Filtering**
   - Never query entire database
   - Always add time range filters
   - Default to 7-30 days for most queries
