# Bug Fix Summary - October 18, 2025

## Issue Reported
The iOS app was showing:
- Only stories from "BBC News" as the source
- No summaries ("No summary available")
- "O sources" for all stories

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. RSS Ingestion Issue
**Problem**: The RSS ingestion function was using `get_initial_feeds()` which returned a limited set of feeds (primarily BBC) when `RSS_USE_ALL_FEEDS` was not set.

**Fix**: Set `RSS_USE_ALL_FEEDS=true` in the Azure Function App settings to enable all 121 RSS feeds.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - RSS ingestion is now polling 5 feeds every 10 seconds from 121 total feeds across 24 unique sources.

### 2. Story Clustering Issue
**Problem**: The Cosmos DB change feed trigger for story clustering wasn't working properly after the initial deployment, causing new stories to be created without the `source_articles` field populated.

**Fix**: Redeployed the Azure Functions to ensure the change feed triggers are properly configured and running.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Story clustering is now working correctly, and new stories have `source_articles` populated.

### 3. API Query Issue
**Problem**: The API's `query_breaking_news` function was using `ORDER BY c.last_updated DESC` in the Cosmos DB query, which was preventing all fields (including `source_articles`) from being returned.

**Fix**: Removed the `ORDER BY` clause from the Cosmos DB query and implemented sorting in Python instead.

**Code Change**:
```python
# Before:
query = """
    SELECT * FROM c
    WHERE c.status IN ('BREAKING', 'DEVELOPING', 'VERIFIED')
    ORDER BY c.last_updated DESC
    OFFSET 0 LIMIT @limit
"""

# After:
query = """
    SELECT * FROM c
    WHERE c.status IN ('BREAKING', 'DEVELOPING', 'VERIFIED')
"""
# Sort in Python
items_sorted = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x.get('last_updated', ''), reverse=True)
return items_sorted[:limit]
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - The API now correctly retrieves and returns source counts.

### 4. Summarization Issue
**Problem**: Stories created when the change feed triggers weren't working don't have summaries.

**Fix**: Enabled the summarization backfill function by setting `SUMMARIZATION_BACKFILL_ENABLED=true`. This function runs every 10 minutes and generates summaries for stories that don't have them.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - The summarization system is working correctly. 86% of stories (1244/1445) already have summaries, and the backfill function will generate summaries for the remaining 14%.

## Verification

### API Response (After Fix)
```json
{
  "id": "story_20251018_001727_83a28a",
  "title": "Texas teens arrested in killing of Marine veteran working as rideshare driver",
  "source_count": 7,
  "sources": 7
}
```

### Database Stats
- Total stories: 1,445
- Stories with summaries: 1,244 (86%)
- Stories without summaries: 201 (14% - will be backfilled)
- RSS feeds active: 121 feeds across 24 unique sources

## Deployment Changes

### Azure Function App Settings
1. `RSS_USE_ALL_FEEDS=true` - Enable all 121 RSS feeds
2. `SUMMARIZATION_BACKFILL_ENABLED=true` - Enable summarization backfill

### Code Changes
1. **API** (`Azure/api/app/services/cosmos_service.py`):
   - Removed `ORDER BY` clause from `query_breaking_news` function
   - Implemented Python-based sorting

2. **Functions** (redeployed):
   - Ensured change feed triggers are properly configured
   - RSS ingestion running every 10 seconds
   - Story clustering change feed active
   - Summarization change feed active
   - Summarization backfill running every 10 minutes

## Expected Behavior

### iOS App (After Fix)
- ✅ Stories from multiple sources (24 unique sources)
- ✅ Correct source counts displayed (e.g., "7 sources", "17 sources")
- ✅ Summaries available for 86% of stories
- ⏳ Remaining 14% will have summaries generated within the next hour

### System Health
- RSS Ingestion: Running every 10 seconds, polling 5 feeds per cycle
- Story Clustering: Active, triggered by new raw articles
- Summarization: Active, triggered by new/updated stories
- Summarization Backfill: Running every 10 minutes to catch up on missing summaries

## Notes

1. The issue was caused by a combination of factors:
   - Limited RSS feeds being used
   - Change feed triggers not working after initial deployment
   - Cosmos DB query issue preventing fields from being returned

2. All issues have been resolved, and the system is now functioning correctly.

3. The iOS app should now display stories from multiple sources with correct source counts and summaries.

4. The summarization backfill will continue to run every 10 minutes until all stories have summaries.

## Recommendations

1. Monitor the summarization backfill progress over the next hour to ensure all stories get summaries.
2. Consider disabling `SUMMARIZATION_BACKFILL_ENABLED` once all stories have summaries to save costs.
3. Monitor Application Insights (once configured) to track function execution and errors.
