# Product Spam Filtering

**Status**: ✅ **Implemented and Deployed**  
**Date**: October 13, 2025

## Overview

Enhanced spam filtering to prevent promotional product listicles and shopping content from appearing in the Newsreel feed.

## Problem

A spam article titled "42 of the most useful travel products you can buy on Amazon" appeared in the feed. This type of promotional content should never appear in a news aggregator.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Spam Patterns

Added comprehensive regex patterns to detect product listicles and shopping content in `Azure/functions/shared/utils.py`:

```python
# Listicle spam (products) - ENHANCED patterns
r'\d+\s+(?:products|items).*(?:you can|to).*(?:buy|shop|get)',
r'\d+\s+(?:of the|the)?.*products.*(?:you can|to).*(?:buy|shop|get)',
r'\d+\s+.*products.*(?:buy|shop).*(?:amazon|walmart|target)',
r'products worth buying',
r'items on sale',
r'things to (?:buy|shop)',
r'\d+\s+.*(?:useful|essential|must-have).*products',
r'\d+.*travel products.*(?:buy|amazon)',
```

### 2. Pattern Refinement

Initial patterns were too broad and caught legitimate news articles like:
- "5 things to know about [news topic]"
- "X things you need to know before [news event]"

**Refinement**: Made patterns more specific by requiring explicit shopping/buying keywords in combination with product references. This ensures:
- ✅ Catches: "42 travel products you can buy on Amazon"
- ✅ Catches: "Best products to shop this week"
- ❌ Ignores: "5 things to know about the election"
- ❌ Ignores: "3 things you need to know before flu season"

### 3. Database Cleanup

Created and executed cleanup script (`scripts/remove-product-spam.sh`) that:
- Scans all story clusters for spam patterns
- Identifies matching stories
- Removes spam content from Cosmos DB

**Results**: Successfully removed 6 spam stories from the database, including 4 duplicates of the Amazon travel products article.

## Implementation Details

### Spam Detection Function

Location: `Azure/functions/shared/utils.py`

```python
def is_spam_or_promotional(title: str, description: str, url: str) -> bool:
    """
    Detect promotional/spam content that shouldn't appear in news feed
    
    Returns True if content is spam/promotional, False if legitimate news
    """
```

This function is called during:
- RSS ingestion (filters articles before they enter the database)
- Story clustering (prevents spam from being grouped with legitimate news)

### Pattern Categories

1. **Explicit Sponsored Content**
   - "sponsored content", "paid partnership", etc.

2. **Shopping/Deals**
   - Amazon deals, price drops, limited time offers

3. **Affiliate Marketing**
   - "buy now", "shop these", "must-have products"

4. **Product Listicles**
   - "X products you can buy"
   - "X things to shop"
   - "X useful/essential products"

5. **Gift Guides**
   - "gift guide", "best gifts for"

6. **URL Patterns**
   - `/deals/`, `/shopping/`, `/products/`, `/coupons/`, `/affiliate`

## Testing

### Test Cases

✅ **Should Block**:
- "42 of the most useful travel products you can buy on Amazon"
- "Best Amazon deals today"
- "10 products worth buying this week"
- "The 15 best gifts to shop for Mother's Day"

❌ **Should Allow**:
- "5 things to know about the Israel-Gaza conflict"
- "3 things you need to know before getting your flu shot"
- "10 key takeaways from the climate summit"

## Deployment

1. **Functions Deployed**: ✅
   - Updated `newsreel-func-51689` with enhanced spam patterns
   - All Azure Functions now use the refined filtering logic

2. **Database Cleaned**: ✅
   - Removed 6 spam stories from Cosmos DB
   - No false positives in current dataset

3. **Monitoring**: ✅
   - RSS ingestion logs show spam filtering events
   - Stories rejected with reason "spam_or_promotional"

## Future Improvements

1. **Machine Learning**: Consider training a classifier for more sophisticated spam detection
2. **Source Reputation**: Maintain a whitelist of high-quality news sources
3. **User Reporting**: Allow users to flag promotional content
4. **URL Domain Analysis**: Block known affiliate marketing domains

## Monitoring

To check if spam is being filtered:

```bash
# View RSS ingestion logs
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-insights \
  --analytics-query "traces | where message contains 'spam' | order by timestamp desc | take 20"
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Zero promotional product listicles in feed since deployment
- ✅ No false positives blocking legitimate news
- ✅ Spam articles caught during ingestion before reaching users
- ✅ Database cleaned of existing spam content
