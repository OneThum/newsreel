## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE - UNDER INVESTIGATION

### **Problem Identified** (October 17, 2025)

**Status**: üî¥ All users experiencing zero sources and empty summaries

**Root Cause**: Story clustering pipeline not functioning - stories stuck in MONITORING status

**Impact**: 
- Users see 0 sources per story (should be 1-10+)
- Summaries are empty (should be AI-generated)
- Stories show no variety in sources
- Feed lacks the multi-perspective angle

**Evidence**:
- All 20+ stories have identical structure: `status: "MONITORING"`, `source_articles: []`, `summary: {text: ""}`
- No status transitions occurring (MONITORING ‚Üí DEVELOPING ‚Üí VERIFIED)
- RSS ingestion IS working (~20 articles/minute)
- API IS working (returns what's in DB)
- All 5 Azure Functions deployed and running

**Next Steps**:
1. Verify Cosmos DB change feed is enabled on `raw_articles` container
2. Check if `StoryClusteringChangeFeed` function binding is correct
3. Review function execution logs for errors
4. Validate `leases` container change feed tracking
5. Perform manual test by inserting article to trigger change feed

See `FINAL_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT.md` for full investigation details.
