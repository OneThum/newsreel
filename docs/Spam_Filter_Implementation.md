# Spam & Promotional Content Filter 🚫

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Issue**: Promotional content appearing in news feed (e.g., "The 10 best Amazon deals to shop this week")  
**Status**: Implemented & Deployed

---

## 🐛 The Problem

**User Report**:
> Screenshot of CNN article: "The 10 best Amazon deals to shop this week"
> "This is advertising/spam and should never make it to the Newsreel feed."

**Symptoms**:
- Shopping/deals articles appearing in feed
- Affiliate marketing content
- Product listicles masquerading as news
- Gift guides and promotional content

**Why It's Bad**:
- ❌ Degrades user trust
- ❌ Not actual news
- ❌ Looks like clickbait/spam app
- ❌ Wastes API costs on non-news content

---

## ✅ The Solution

### Implementation: Pre-Ingestion Filtering

Added spam detection **at RSS ingestion level**, before articles enter the database.

```python
# In process_feed_entry() - Azure/functions/function_app.py
if is_spam_or_promotional(title, description, article_url):
    logger.info(f"🚫 Filtered spam/promotional content: {title[:80]}...")
    return None  # Skip this article entirely
```

**Why Pre-Ingestion?**
- ✅ Never enters database
- ✅ Never gets clustered or summarized
- ✅ Saves all downstream processing costs
- ✅ Clean data from the start

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Logs to Watch

**Filtered Content** (expected):
```
🚫 Filtered spam/promotional content: The 10 best Amazon deals to shop...
🚫 Filtered spam/promotional content: Top 5 products you need to buy...
```

**Metrics to Track**:
- Total articles fetched
- Articles filtered (spam count)
- Filter rate per source
- False positives (legitimate news blocked)

### Dashboard Queries

```bash
# Count spam filtered in last hour
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-app-insights \
  --analytics-query "traces | where message contains 'Filtered spam' | count"

# Top spam sources
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-app-insights \
  --analytics-query "traces | where message contains 'Filtered spam' | summarize count() by source"
```

---

## 🔧 Tuning the Filter

### If Legitimate News Is Blocked (False Positive)

**Example**: "Amazon announces 10 best practices for sustainability"

**Problem**: Matches `r'\d+\s+best.*'` but is legitimate news

**Solution**: Make pattern more specific
```python
# BAD (too broad)
r'\d+\s+best.*'

# GOOD (specific to shopping)
r'\d+\s+best.*(?:deals|products|buys|items|to shop|to buy)'
```

### If Spam Gets Through (False Negative)

**Example**: "Amazing deals on tech gadgets this week"

**Problem**: Doesn't match existing patterns (no number, no "best")

**Solution**: Add new pattern
```python
spam_patterns.append(r'amazing deals on')
```

### Filter Adjustment Process

1. **Identify Pattern**: What common phrase appears in spam?
2. **Create Regex**: Write specific pattern
3. **Test Legitimate News**: Ensure it doesn't match real news
4. **Add to List**: Update `spam_patterns` in `utils.py`
5. **Deploy**: Push to Azure Functions
6. **Monitor**: Watch for false positives

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Current): ✅ Implemented
- Basic pattern matching
- URL-based filtering
- Pre-ingestion blocking

### Phase 2 (Future): Machine Learning
```python
def is_spam_ml(title: str, description: str) -> bool:
    """Use ML model to detect spam"""
    # Train on labeled dataset
    # Features: title length, word frequency, source reputation
    # Output: spam probability
    pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Catches subtle spam patterns
- Learns new spam tactics
- Reduces false positives

### Phase 3 (Future): Source Reputation
```python
# Track spam rate per source
source_spam_rates = {
    'cnn': 0.05,  # 5% of CNN articles are spam
    'bbc': 0.01,  # 1% of BBC articles are spam
}

# If source consistently produces spam, lower priority or block
```

### Phase 4 (Future): User Feedback
```swift
// iOS app: Report spam button
Button("Report as Spam") {
    apiService.reportSpam(storyId: story.id)
}

// Backend: Track user reports, improve filter
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Test

1. **Wait for next CNN RSS poll** (~5-10 minutes)
2. **Check logs** for filtered content:
   ```bash
   az monitor app-insights query \
     --app newsreel-app-insights \
     --analytics-query "traces | where message contains 'Filtered spam' | project timestamp, message"
   ```
3. **Verify feed** no longer shows promotional content

### Synthetic Test

```python
# Test the filter function directly
from shared.utils import is_spam_or_promotional

# Should return True (spam)
assert is_spam_or_promotional(
    "The 10 best Amazon deals to shop this week",
    "Check out these amazing products on sale",
    "https://cnn.com/shopping/amazon-deals"
)

# Should return False (legitimate news)
assert not is_spam_or_promotional(
    "Amazon faces antitrust lawsuit",
    "Federal regulators file charges",
    "https://cnn.com/business/amazon-lawsuit"
)
```

- Only ingest legitimate journalism

### Prevention

**For New Sources**:
- Test RSS feeds before adding
- Check for promotional content
- Monitor spam rate per source
- Adjust filters as needed

**For Existing Sources**:
- Continuous monitoring
- User feedback integration
- Automated quality checks
