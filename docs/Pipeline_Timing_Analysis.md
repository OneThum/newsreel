# Pipeline Timing Analysis & Optimization üìä

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Issue**: User seeing 9-10 minute delays for new stories  
**Status**: Analyzed + UX Improvement Implemented

---

## üîç User Question

> "It would seem strange that it would take 9 or 10m for a story to work through our system and then get a new news notification?"

**Valid concern!** Let's break down the pipeline.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Current Pipeline Timing

### Full Journey: News Article ‚Üí iOS Notification

```
1. ‚ö°Ô∏è News Event Happens (ESPN publishes article)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Instant

2. üì∞ ESPN RSS Feed Updates
   ‚îî‚îÄ 0-5 minutes (ESPN's delay)

3. üîÑ Our RSS Ingestion Polls ESPN
   ‚îî‚îÄ 0-5 minutes (our polling cycle)
   
4. üß† Story Clustering (Cosmos DB Changefeed)
   ‚îî‚îÄ ~1-2 seconds
   
5. ‚ú® AI Summarization (Claude API)
   ‚îî‚îÄ ~2-5 seconds (if content available)
   
6. üì± iOS App Polls API
   ‚îî‚îÄ 0-30 seconds
   
7. üéØ User Sees "1 new story" pill
   ‚îî‚îÄ Instant

TOTAL: 5-10 minutes (worst case)
```

## üéØ The Real Bottleneck: Staggered RSS Polling

### Current Strategy (Cost Optimization)

Our RSS ingestion uses **staggered polling** to balance cost vs. freshness:

```python
# From function_app.py:
@app.schedule(schedule="*/10 * * * * *")  # Runs every 10 seconds
async def rss_ingestion_timer():
    """
    With 100 feeds over 5 minutes (300 seconds):
    - Polling ~3-4 feeds every 10 seconds (30 cycles per 5 min)
    - Results in 1 feed every 3 seconds (continuous firehose!)
    - More responsive to breaking news with 3x more frequent polling
    """
    
    # Poll if never polled OR if 5 minutes have passed
    if not last_poll or (now - last_poll).total_seconds() >= 300:
        feeds_to_poll.append(feed_config)
```

**What This Means**:
- ‚úÖ Each feed polled **every 5 minutes**
- ‚úÖ But polls are **staggered**, not all at once
- ‚úÖ Continuous flow of articles (not batches)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ESPN might be early or late in the 5-minute cycle**

### Example Timeline

```
T+0:00 - ESPN publishes article
T+0:30 - ESPN's RSS feed updates (typical delay)
T+2:30 - Our system polls ESPN (we're on 5-min cycle)
T+2:32 - Clustering + Summarization
T+3:00 - iOS polls and sees new story
T+3:00 - User sees "1 new story" pill

Total: ~3 minutes (mid-cycle)
```

**But if ESPN is at the END of our cycle**:
```
T+0:00 - ESPN publishes article
T+0:30 - ESPN's RSS feed updates
T+4:45 - Our system polls ESPN (waited almost full cycle)
T+4:47 - Clustering + Summarization
T+5:15 - iOS polls and sees new story

Total: ~5.25 minutes (end-of-cycle)
```

**And if ESPN's RSS itself is slow**:
```
T+0:00 - ESPN publishes article
T+4:00 - ESPN's RSS feed finally updates (slow!)
T+4:45 - Our system polls ESPN
T+4:47 - Clustering + Summarization
T+5:15 - iOS polls

Total: ~5.25 minutes from publish, but only ~1.25 minutes from RSS update
```

## üéØ Why 9-10 Minutes?

If you're seeing **9-10 minutes consistently**, here are the likely causes:

### 1. **ESPN's RSS Feed Delay** (Most Likely)
- ESPN publishes article ‚Üí RSS feed updates 5-7 minutes later
- Our system picks it up quickly
- Total: ESPN's delay + our pipeline

### 2. **Missed Polling Cycle**
- We poll ESPN at T+0:00
- ESPN updates at T+0:30 (just missed it!)
- We poll again at T+5:30
- Total: 5 minutes of "just missed" delay

### 3. **Cosmos DB Changefeed Backlog**
- If clustering or summarization changefeeds are backed up
- Usually NOT the case (they're quite fast)

### 4. **iOS Polling** 
- App polls every 30 seconds
- Could add up to 30 seconds to perceived delay

## üí° Optimization Options

### Phase 1: Hot Sources (Quick Win) ‚ö°Ô∏è

**Idea**: Poll high-priority sources more frequently

```python
HOT_SOURCES = {
    'espn': 60,      # Every 1 minute
    'bbc': 60,
    'reuters': 60,
    'ap': 60,
    'cnn': 120,      # Every 2 minutes
    'nyt': 120,
    # Others: 300 (5 minutes)
}

# Check if source needs polling
poll_interval = HOT_SOURCES.get(feed_config.name, 300)
if (now - last_poll).total_seconds() >= poll_interval:
    feeds_to_poll.append(feed_config)
```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Breaking news from major sources: **1-2 minutes**
- ‚úÖ Other sources: **5 minutes** (same as now)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Increased cost**: ~2-3x more polls for hot sources

**Cost Analysis**:
- Current: 100 feeds √ó 12 polls/hour = 1,200 polls/hour
- With hot feeds: 10 hot feeds √ó 60 polls/hour + 90 feeds √ó 12 polls/hour = **1,680 polls/hour**
- Increase: +40% more RSS fetches
- Azure Functions cost: Still well within free tier (1M requests/month)

---

### Phase 2: Smart iOS Polling (Future) üß†

**Idea**: Reduce iOS polling frequency when no activity

```swift
// Variable polling: 10s when active, 60s when idle
private var pollingInterval: TimeInterval {
    // Recent activity? Poll frequently
    if lastUserInteraction.timeIntervalSinceNow > -300 { // 5 min
        return 10 // Fast polling
    } else {
        return 60 // Slow polling
    }
}
```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Responsive when user is active
- ‚úÖ Battery savings when idle
- ‚úÖ Lower API costs

---

### Phase 3: Server-Side Push (Long-term) üöÄ

**Idea**: Backend pushes updates to iOS via Apple Push Notifications

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ **Near-instant** notifications (5-10 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Massive battery savings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires APNs setup + backend changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complexity: high

---

## üì± UX Improvement: Scroll to Story (‚úÖ Implemented)

### The Issue
User: *"When I tap on '1 new story' - as long as it takes me to that story, I'm happy. I don't need it to go to the top of the feed if that story isn't at the top."*

**Valid point!** With our smart sorting:
- BREAKING story ‚Üí appears at top ‚úÖ
- MONITORING story ‚Üí appears lower ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Scrolling to top for a MONITORING story is confusing

### The Fix

**Before**:
```swift
// Always scroll to top
viewModel.loadPendingNewStories()
viewModel.shouldScrollToTop = true
```

**After**:
```swift
func loadPendingNewStories() {
    // Remember the first new story ID
    let firstNewStoryId = pendingNewStories.first?.id
    
    // Merge and sort stories
    stories = sortStories(pendingNewStories + stories)
    
    // Scroll to wherever the new story ended up
    if let storyId = firstNewStoryId {
        scrollToStoryId = storyId  // Scroll to this specific story
    }
}
```

**Scroll Logic**:
```swift
.onChange(of: viewModel.scrollToStoryId) { _, storyId in
    if let storyId = storyId {
        withAnimation(.easeOut(duration: 0.4)) {
            proxy.scrollTo(storyId, anchor: .center)  // Center on screen
        }
    }
}
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Tap "1 new story" ‚Üí **jumps to that exact story**
- ‚úÖ Story centered on screen (easy to see)
- ‚úÖ Works regardless of where story lands in feed
- ‚úÖ Smooth animation

---

## üìä Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Track

**Backend Logs**:
```bash
# Time from RSS fetch to story cluster
grep "RssFetch" logs | grep "StoryCluster" | 
  awk '{print $1, $2}' | calculate_diff

# Time from cluster to summary
grep "StoryCluster" logs | grep "SummaryGenerated" |
  awk '{print $1, $2}' | calculate_diff
```

**iOS Logs**:
```swift
// Log when new story detected
log.log("üÜï New story detected: \(story.id) published \(story.timeAgo)", 
        category: .api, level: .info)
```

**Admin Dashboard**:
- Average time: RSS fetch ‚Üí User notification
- P50, P90, P99 latencies
- By source (ESPN, BBC, etc.)

---

## üéâ Summary

### Current State
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **5-10 minute delay** (mostly RSS feed delays + polling cycle)
- ‚úÖ **Cost-optimized** polling strategy
- ‚úÖ **Smart sorting** ensures quality stories at top

### Improvements Made Today
- ‚úÖ **Scroll to story** feature implemented
- ‚úÖ **Better UX** for single-source stories

### Why 9-10 Minutes?
Most likely:
1. **ESPN's RSS delay**: 4-5 minutes (ESPN's fault, not ours)
2. **Our polling cycle**: Up to 5 minutes (by design for cost)
3. **iOS polling**: Up to 30 seconds
4. **Total**: Could hit 9-10 minutes in worst case

### Optimization Path
- **Quick win**: Hot source polling (1-2 min for ESPN, BBC, Reuters)
- **Medium term**: Smart iOS polling
- **Long term**: Push notifications (< 10 seconds)

## üí∞ Cost vs. Speed Tradeoff

| Strategy | Speed | Cost | Complexity |
|----------|-------|------|------------|
| **Current (5-min cycle)** | 5-10 min | $Free | ‚úÖ Simple |
| **Hot sources (1-min)** | 1-3 min | $5-10/mo | ‚úÖ Simple |
| **Smart polling** | 1-3 min | $3-5/mo | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium |
| **Push notifications** | 5-10 sec | $10-20/mo | ‚ùå Complex |

**Recommendation**: Start with **hot source polling**. Easy to implement, big UX improvement, minimal cost.

---

## üöÄ Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Hot Source Polling (1 hour)

```python
# Add to function_app.py
HOT_SOURCES = {
    'espn': 60,
    'bbc': 60,
    'reuters': 60,
    'ap': 60,
}

# Update polling logic
poll_interval = HOT_SOURCES.get(feed_config.name, 300)
if (now - last_poll).total_seconds() >= poll_interval:
    feeds_to_poll.append(feed_config)
```

### Step 2: Deploy & Monitor (1 week)
- Deploy change
- Monitor admin dashboard
- Track P50/P90 latencies
- Verify cost increase is acceptable

### Step 3: Iterate (ongoing)
- Add/remove hot sources based on usage
- Adjust intervals based on metrics
- Consider smart polling if battery becomes issue

---

**Bottom Line**: The 9-10 minute delay is mostly due to:
1. RSS feed providers' own delays
2. Our intentional 5-minute polling cycle (cost optimization)

We can improve this to **1-3 minutes** with hot source polling at minimal cost increase. ‚úÖ
