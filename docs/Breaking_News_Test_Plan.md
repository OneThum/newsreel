# üî• Breaking News Test Plan - Live Testing with Gaza Hostage Release

**Created**: 2025-10-13 05:39 UTC  
**Test Story**: Gaza Hostage Release (ongoing)  
**Story ID**: `story_20251012_084423_58f041ad44cd`  
**Status**: üü¢ **TESTING IN PROGRESS**

---

## üéØ Test Objectives

### Primary Goal:
Verify that the Israel/Gaza hostage release story (happening RIGHT NOW) is properly detected as breaking news and displayed prominently in the feed.

### Success Criteria:
1. ‚úÖ Story promoted to BREAKING when new sources add articles
2. ‚úÖ Story stays BREAKING for up to 90 minutes after last update
3. ‚úÖ Story resurfaces to TOP of feed on every update
4. ‚úÖ Users see üö® BREAKING badge
5. ‚úÖ Status transitions to VERIFIED after 90 min of no updates

---

## üìä Configuration Changes

### Deployed (05:39 UTC):

**1. Extended Breaking News Duration:**
```python
# Before: 30 minutes
# After: 90 minutes

if time_since_update >= timedelta(minutes=90):
    # Transition BREAKING ‚Üí VERIFIED
```

**Why:** Major breaking news (hostage releases, elections, disasters) develops over hours, not minutes. 90 minutes allows multiple update cycles while story is actively developing.

**2. Extended Active Development Window:**
```python
# Before: 15 minutes
# After: 30 minutes

elif is_gaining_sources and time_since_update < timedelta(minutes=30):
    status = StoryStatus.BREAKING.value
```

**Why:** Some sources report slower than others. 30-minute window catches all major sources while story is fresh.

**3. Enhanced Logging:**
```python
logger.info(
    f"üìä Status evaluation: sources={prev}‚Üí{new}, "
    f"age={age}m, last_update={idle}m ago, "
    f"current_status={status}, is_gaining={gaining}"
)
```

**Why:** Real-time visibility into status evaluation decisions for debugging.

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Story Promotion to BREAKING

**Setup:**
- Story exists: "Gaza ceasefire problem" (created Oct 12)
- Current status: VERIFIED
- Current sources: 5

**Expected Behavior:**
- New source adds article (e.g., Reuters)
- `is_gaining_sources = True`
- `time_since_update = 0-30 minutes`
- Status: VERIFIED ‚Üí BREAKING üî•
- Story jumps to top of feed
- Log: "üî• Story promoted to BREAKING (actively developing)"

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Check if promotion happened
./check-story-now.sh story_20251012_084423_58f041ad44cd

# Expected: "Current Status: BREAKING"
```

---

### Scenario 2: Story Stays BREAKING During Development

**Setup:**
- Story status: BREAKING
- Multiple sources adding articles over time

**Expected Behavior:**
- Story receives new article every 10-30 minutes
- Each update: `last_updated` timestamp changes
- Status: BREAKING (maintained)
- Story stays at top of feed
- Log: "‚Üí Keeping BREAKING status (actively updated story)"

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Monitor in real-time (updates every 30 seconds)
./monitor-breaking-news.sh

# Watch for:
# - "Added [source] source ‚Üí X total"
# - "Status: BREAKING (continues)"
```

---

### Scenario 3: Story Transitions to VERIFIED

**Setup:**
- Story status: BREAKING
- No new sources for 90 minutes

**Expected Behavior:**
- 90 minutes pass with no updates
- BreakingNewsMonitor runs (every 5 min)
- Detects: `time_since_update >= 90 minutes`
- Status: BREAKING ‚Üí VERIFIED
- Story stays visible but badge changes
- Log: "üîÑ Status transition: BREAKING ‚Üí VERIFIED (idle: 90m)"

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Check for transition
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(2h) | where message contains 'Status transition' and message contains 'story_20251012_084423_58f041ad44cd' | project timestamp, message"

# Expected: "Status transition: BREAKING ‚Üí VERIFIED - No updates for 90 minutes"
```

---

### Scenario 4: Feed Ordering

**Setup:**
- Multiple stories in feed
- Gaza story gets updated

**Expected Behavior:**
- Before update: Gaza story on page 2-3
- New source added: `last_updated` changes
- Feed re-sorts by `max(first_seen, last_updated)`
- Gaza story moves to position #1
- User sees story at top on next refresh

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Check feed order via API (requires auth)
# Or check in iOS app
```

### Real-Time Monitor (Recommended):
```bash
cd /Users/davemac/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-OneThumSoftware/One\ Thum\ Software/Newsreel/Azure/scripts

# Start continuous monitoring (updates every 30s)
./monitor-breaking-news.sh
```

**Output includes:**
- Latest story status
- Recent source additions
- Breaking news monitor activity
- Status transitions

---

### Quick Status Check:
```bash
# Get current status of Gaza story

```

**Output includes:**
- Current status (BREAKING/VERIFIED)
- Source count
- Time since last update
- Recommendations

---

### Manual Queries:

**Check Story Status Evolution:**
```bash
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(30m) | where message contains 'story_20251012_084423_58f041ad44cd' | where message contains 'Status evaluation' or message contains 'promoted to BREAKING' or message contains 'Story Cluster:' | project timestamp, message | order by timestamp desc | take 20"
```

**Check Breaking News Promotions:**
```bash
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(30m) | where message contains 'üî•' or message contains 'promoted to BREAKING' | project timestamp, message | order by timestamp desc | take 10"
```

**Check Status Transitions:**
```bash
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(2h) | where message contains 'üîÑ Status transition' | project timestamp, message | order by timestamp desc | take 10"
```

## üìä Expected Timeline

Based on current behavior (05:39 UTC):

**05:39** - Deployment complete, function restarting  
**05:41** - Function active, RSS polling resumes  
**05:45** - Next potential story update (if new source reports)  
**05:45** - Status evaluation logged  
**05:45** - Story promoted to BREAKING (if conditions met)  
**05:46** - Story visible at top of feed  
**07:15** - Story transitions to VERIFIED (if no updates for 90 min)

## üéì What We're Testing

### Core Hypothesis:
**"Actively developing stories should be marked as BREAKING and stay visible at the top of the feed, regardless of when they were originally created."**

### Key Assumptions:
1. ‚úÖ RSS feeds reporting on Gaza hostage release
2. ‚úÖ Multiple sources (AP, Reuters, BBC, CNN, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Clustering working (articles merged into one story)
4. ‚úÖ Sources adding articles over time (not all at once)

### Variables:
- **Independent:** New sources adding articles
- **Dependent:** Story status (BREAKING vs VERIFIED)
- **Control:** Story age, source count, update frequency

### Metrics:
- Time to promotion (seconds from new source to BREAKING)
- Duration of BREAKING status (minutes)
- Number of updates while BREAKING
- Transition timing (minutes idle before VERIFIED)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Story Not Promoted to BREAKING

**Check:**
1. Is story gaining sources? `is_gaining_sources = True`?
2. Was last update recent? `time_since_update < 30 min`?
3. Does story have 3+ sources? `verification_level >= 3`?
4. Are new articles being added? Check RSS logs
5. Is clustering working? Check for "Added [source]" logs

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check status evaluation logs
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(10m) | where message contains 'Status evaluation' and message contains 'story_20251012_084423_58f041ad44cd' | project timestamp, message"

# Check recent source additions
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(30m) | where message contains 'Added' and message contains 'story_20251012_084423_58f041ad44cd' | project timestamp, message | order by timestamp desc"
```

---

### Issue: Story Not Visible at Top of Feed

**Check:**
1. Is `last_updated` timestamp changing?
2. Is API sorting by `max(first_seen, last_updated)`?
3. Are there newer stories pushing it down?
4. Is app caching old feed data?

**Debug:**
- Check API response directly
- Force app refresh (pull-to-refresh)
- Verify story `last_updated` field

---

### Issue: Story Transitions Too Early

**Check:**
1. Is 90-minute timeout configured correctly?
2. Is BreakingNewsMonitor using `time_since_update`?
3. Are new sources still being added?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check transition logs
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(2h) | where message contains 'Status transition' | project timestamp, message | order by timestamp desc"
```

---

## üìà Success Metrics

### Quantitative:
- **Story visibility**: Should be position #1 when BREAKING
- **Status duration**: BREAKING for 30-90 minutes (depending on updates)
- **Update frequency**: New sources every 10-30 minutes
- **Transition accuracy**: VERIFIED after exactly 90 min idle

### Qualitative:
- **User experience**: Story is prominent and obvious
- **Badge accuracy**: BREAKING badge matches status
- **Feed relevance**: Most important news at top
- **Timeliness**: Updates appear quickly (< 1 min delay)

---

## üîÑ Iteration Plan

### If Test Fails:

**1. Diagnose Root Cause**
- Check logs for error messages
- Verify configuration deployed correctly
- Test individual components (RSS, clustering, status logic)

**2. Adjust Parameters**
- Increase/decrease timeouts
- Modify status evaluation logic
- Add more logging

**3. Redeploy & Retest**
- Deploy fix immediately
- Monitor with real-time tools
- Verify fix within 5-10 minutes

**4. Document Findings**
- Update this test plan
- Document any edge cases
- Improve monitoring tools

---

## üí° Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Advanced Testing

**1. Multiple Breaking Stories**
- Test with 2-3 simultaneous breaking news events
- Verify feed ordering is correct
- Check for resource contention

**2. Edge Cases**
- Very old story (weeks) getting sudden update
- Story with 20+ sources
- Rapid updates (new source every minute)
- Slow updates (new source every hour)

**3. Performance**
- Measure API response time
- Check database query efficiency
- Monitor function execution time

**4. User Impact**
- A/B test different timeout values
- Measure user engagement with breaking news
- Track click-through rates on BREAKING stories

## üéØ Next Actions

1. **Start monitoring** (run `./monitor-breaking-news.sh`)
2. **Wait for next update** (Gaza story actively developing)
3. **Verify promotion** (story should become BREAKING)
4. **Check feed** (story should be at top)
5. **Monitor duration** (should stay BREAKING for 30-90 min)
6. **Verify transition** (should become VERIFIED after 90 min idle)
7. **Document results** (update this file with findings)
