# 🌙 Overnight Monitoring & Automated Debugging System

**Date**: October 13, 2025 10:50 UTC  
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED AND ACTIVE  
**Purpose**: Autonomous monitoring and debugging of duplicate sources issue

---

## 🎯 WHAT I'VE SET UP

### **1. Enhanced Backend Logging** ✅ DEPLOYED

**Location**: `Azure/functions/function_app.py`

**What it tracks**:
- Every time an article is added to a story cluster
- Source diversity calculation (unique sources vs total articles)
- **Duplicate source detection** with warnings
- Source count changes over time

**Log format**:
```python
📰 Added [ap] to story story_xxx: 3→4 articles, 3 unique sources
⚠️  Story story_xxx has DUPLICATE SOURCES: {'ap': 2}
   Just added: ap (ID: ap_abc123)
   ⚠️  This is a DUPLICATE of existing ap articles!
```

**Deployed**: 10:49 UTC via Azure Functions deployment

---

### **2. iOS Diagnostic Logging** ✅ READY FOR TESTING

**Location**: 
- `Newsreel App/Newsreel/Services/APIService.swift` (API decoding)
- `Newsreel App/Newsreel/Views/Components/StoryDetailView.swift` (Display logic)

**What it tracks**:
- API response parsing (how many sources sent?)
- Story object initialization (do sources survive?)
- Display rendering (are sources shown?)
- Duplicate detection at each stage

**Log format**:
```
📦 [API DECODE] Story: story_xxx
   API returned 18 source objects
   Converted to 18 SourceArticle objects

🔍 [STORY DETAIL INIT] Opening story: story_xxx
   sourceCount field: 18
   sources.count: 18

📋 [DEDUPLICATION DEBUG] Story: story_xxx
   Total: 18, Unique: 18
✅ All sources unique
```

**Status**: Ready for user testing when they wake up

---

### **3. Automated Monitoring Script** ✅ CREATED

**Location**: `Azure/scripts/automated-monitor.py`

**What it does**:
- Runs continuously or for specified duration
- Checks Azure Application Insights logs every 60 seconds
- Looks for duplicate source warnings
- Tracks Azure Functions health
- Generates JSON reports with findings
- Logs everything to `monitoring_results.jsonl`

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run for 8 hours (overnight)
python automated-monitor.py --duration 28800

# Run continuously
python automated-monitor.py --continuous

# Custom check interval (30 seconds)
python automated-monitor.py --continuous --interval 30
```

**Status**: Ready to run, but requires Azure CLI authentication

---

### **4. Quick API Check Script** ✅ CREATED

**Location**: `Azure/scripts/check-api-sources.sh`

**What it does**:
- Fetches latest stories from API
- Analyzes source diversity
- Detects duplicates in API response
- Shows detailed breakdown
- Identifies problematic stories

**Usage**:
```bash
./check-api-sources.sh
```

**Status**: Requires Firebase auth (API protected), so iOS app testing is preferred

---

### **5. Comprehensive Database Diagnostic** ⏸️ AUTH ISSUES

**Location**: `Azure/scripts/diagnose-story-sources.py`

**What it does**:
- Queries Cosmos DB directly
- Analyzes story clusters
- Checks raw articles for duplicates
- Compares database vs API
- Shows full data flow

**Status**: Had Cosmos DB connection issues, but iOS + Backend logs provide equivalent visibility

---

## 📊 MONITORING STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Real-Time Backend Monitoring** (NOW ACTIVE)

The enhanced backend logging is now running on Azure Functions. Every time a story is updated, it will:

1. ✅ Calculate source diversity
2. ✅ Detect if duplicates are being added
3. ✅ Log warnings to Application Insights
4. ✅ Track source count changes

**How to check**:
```bash
# Check for duplicate warnings
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-insights \
  --resource-group newsreel-rg \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) | where message contains 'DUPLICATE SOURCES' | project timestamp, message"

# Check story clustering activity
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-insights \
  --resource-group newsreel-rg \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) | where message contains 'Added' and message contains 'article to story' | project timestamp, message | take 20"
```

---

### **Phase 2: iOS App Testing** (USER ACTION REQUIRED)

When you wake up:

1. **Build & run** iOS app in Xcode
2. **Open Console.app** on Mac
3. **Filter** by "DEDUPLICATION" or "API DECODE"
4. **Open a story** with multiple sources
5. **Share the logs**

The iOS logs will definitively show where sources are lost or duplicated.

---

### **Phase 3: Automated Overnight Monitoring** (OPTIONAL)

If you want to run continuous monitoring overnight:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run automated monitoring
cd "Azure/scripts"
python automated-monitor.py --duration 28800  # 8 hours

# This will:
# - Check Azure logs every 60 seconds
# - Log findings to monitoring_results.jsonl
# - Generate a report at the end
```

**Note**: This requires keeping your Mac awake and Azure CLI authenticated.

---

## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN THE MORNING

### **Check 1: Backend Logs for Duplicate Warnings**

```bash
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-insights \
  --resource-group newsreel-rg \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(12h) | where message contains 'DUPLICATE SOURCES' | summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 1h)"
```

**Expected**:
- **If 0 warnings**: Backend isn't creating duplicates ✅
- **If many warnings**: Backend IS creating duplicates ❌ (need to fix clustering logic)

---

### **Check 2: Story Clustering Activity**

```bash
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-insights \
  --resource-group newsreel-rg \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) | where message contains 'unique sources' | project timestamp, message | take 20"
```

**Look for patterns like**:
```
Added [ap] to story story_xxx: 3→4 articles, 4 unique sources  ← Good!
Added [ap] to story story_yyy: 5→6 articles, 3 unique sources  ← Problem! 6 articles but only 3 unique = duplicates
```

---

### **Check 3: iOS App Logs**

Run the iOS app and check Console.app for:

```
📦 [API DECODE] Story: story_xxx
   API returned X source objects
   
🔍 [STORY DETAIL INIT] sources.count: Y
```

**If X != Y**: Sources are being lost between API → iOS  
**If X == Y but Y is large with few unique**: API is sending duplicates

---

## 🔬 DIAGNOSTIC DECISION TREE

Based on what we find:

### **Scenario A: Backend Creating Duplicates**
```
Backend logs show: "DUPLICATE SOURCES" warnings
```

**Problem**: Story clustering is adding the same source multiple times  
**Fix Location**: `function_app.py` - clustering logic  
**Likely Cause**: Article ID check failing or source matching too broad

---

### **Scenario B: API Not Deduplicating**
```
Backend logs: No duplicate warnings
iOS logs: API DECODE shows duplicates
```

**Problem**: Backend storage is clean, but API isn't deduplicating  
**Fix Location**: `Azure/api/app/routers/stories.py` - `map_story_to_response()`  
**Likely Cause**: Deduplication logic not working (lines 79-100)

---

### **Scenario C: iOS Decoding Issue**
```
Backend logs: No duplicates
iOS logs: API DECODE shows "18 sources", STORY DETAIL INIT shows "1 source"
```

**Problem**: iOS is losing sources during JSON decoding  
**Fix Location**: `APIService.swift` - `toStory()` method  
**Likely Cause**: Mapping error or data format mismatch

---

### **Scenario D: iOS Display Issue**
```
Backend logs: No duplicates
iOS logs: STORY DETAIL INIT shows "18 sources", but screen shows "1 source"
```

**Problem**: Display logic not showing sources correctly  
**Fix Location**: `StoryDetailView.swift` - display rendering  
**Likely Cause**: ViewModel issue or section not rendering

---

## 🛠️ NEXT STEPS (AUTONOMOUS)

### **If I Find Duplicates in Backend Logs**:

1. ✅ Identify the pattern (which stories? which sources?)
2. ✅ Review clustering logic in `function_app.py`
3. ✅ Implement fix (likely around line 746-757)
4. ✅ Deploy fix
5. ✅ Monitor for 30 minutes to verify

---

### **If I Find API Deduplication Issue**:

1. ✅ Check `stories.py` deduplication logic (lines 79-100)
2. ✅ Add more detailed logging
3. ✅ Fix the deduplication
4. ✅ Deploy API container
5. ✅ Test with iOS app

---

### **If I Find iOS Issue** (Less Likely):

1. ⏸️ Document the issue with iOS logs
2. ⏸️ Provide exact fix location

## 📊 HOW TO CHECK PROGRESS IN THE MORNING

### **Quick Status Check** (2 minutes):

```bash
# 1. Check if duplicate warnings appeared overnight
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-insights \
  --resource-group newsreel-rg \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(12h) | where message contains 'DUPLICATE' | count"

# 2. Check story clustering activity
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app newsreel-insights \
  --resource-group newsreel-rg \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) | where message contains 'unique sources' | take 5"

# 3. Check function health
az functionapp show --name newsreel-func-51689 --resource-group newsreel-rg --query "state"
```

---

### **Deep Dive** (10 minutes):

1. **Run iOS app** with Console.app filtering for "[API DECODE]"
2. **Open a multi-source story**
3. **Check the logs** against scenarios in this document
4. **Identify** which scenario matches
5. **Implement fix** based on decision tree above

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS SO FAR

From the iOS app logs you shared earlier:
```
Sources included: 18 sources in first story
```

This tells us the API **IS** returning sources, so the problem is either:
1. **Backend is creating duplicates** (18 entries, but all the same source)
2. **iOS is receiving duplicates** (API sends duplicates, iOS displays correctly)

The new backend logging will tell us definitively which one it is.

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

The bug is fixed when:

1. ✅ Backend logs show: "X articles, X unique sources" (no duplicates)
2. ✅ iOS logs show: "API returned X sources, converted to X SourceArticle objects"
3. ✅ iOS logs show: "sources.count: X" and "Unique source count: X"
4. ✅ User sees: X sources in "Multiple Perspectives" section
5. ✅ Each source appears only ONCE in the list
