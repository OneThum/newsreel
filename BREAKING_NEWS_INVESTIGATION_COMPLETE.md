# üîç Breaking News Engine Investigation - Complete

**Date**: October 13, 2025 09:12 UTC  
**Status**: ‚úÖ CRITICAL BUG FOUND & FIXED, DEPLOYED

---

## üö® USER CONCERN

**Issue**: "We haven't had any breaking news since the first Gaza story, and there's been several stories related to Israel which should have qualified."

**Question**: "Has the breaking news engine crashed again?"

---

## ‚úÖ INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

### **1. Breaking News Monitor Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING

```
‚úÖ Function executing every 2 minutes (as configured)
‚úÖ No errors or crashes
‚úÖ Successfully completing (278ms, 431ms execution times)
```

**Conclusion**: The monitor is NOT crashed.

---

### **2. Breaking News Detection**: ‚ùå BROKEN (BUG FOUND)

**Log Evidence**:
```
08:41:50 | üìä Status evaluation: sources=4‚Üí4, is_gaining=False
08:41:50 | üìä Status evaluation: sources=4‚Üí4, is_gaining=False
08:41:50 | üìä Status evaluation: sources=6‚Üí6, is_gaining=False
```

**Problem**: ALL stories show `is_gaining=False`, even when they just gained sources!

**Result**: Stories never promoted to BREAKING (except brand new 3+ source stories).

---

### **3. Root Cause**: Python Reference Bug

**The Bug**:
```python
# WRONG ORDER (deployed until 09:06 UTC):
source_articles = story.get('source_articles', [])  # Get REFERENCE to list
source_articles.append(article.id)  # Modify the list
prev_source_count = len(story.get('source_articles', []))  # Already modified! ‚ùå
is_gaining_sources = len(source_articles) > prev_source_count  # 4 > 4 = False
```

**Why It Breaks**:
- `story.get('source_articles', [])` returns a REFERENCE, not a copy
- Appending to `source_articles` modifies the original `story` dict
- When we later check `len(story.get('source_articles', []))`, it already includes the new article
- Result: `prev_source_count` equals `len(source_articles)`, so `is_gaining=False`

---

### **4. Impact on Breaking News**

**Breaking News Promotion Logic**:
```python
if verification_level >= 3:
    if time_since_first < 30 minutes:
        status = BREAKING  # ‚úì Works for NEW stories
    elif is_gaining_sources and time_since_update < 30 minutes:
        status = BREAKING  # ‚ùå NEVER TRIGGERS (is_gaining always False)
```

**Stories Affected**:
- ‚úÖ **New stories** (< 30 min old, 3+ sources): Promoted to BREAKING
- ‚ùå **Ongoing stories** (Gaza, Israel, disasters): NOT promoted to BREAKING

**This explains**:
- First Gaza story: Worked (was brand new when it hit 3 sources)
- Later Israel stories: Failed (older than 30 min, needed `is_gaining=True`)

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX

**Deployed**: October 13, 2025 09:06 UTC

**Change**: Calculate `prev_source_count` BEFORE appending

```python
# CORRECT ORDER (deployed 09:06 UTC):
source_articles = story.get('source_articles', [])
prev_source_count = len(source_articles)  # ‚úì Get count BEFORE modifying
source_articles.append(article.id)  # Now modify
is_gaining_sources = len(source_articles) > prev_source_count  # 4 > 3 = True ‚úì
```

**File**: `Azure/functions/function_app.py`, lines 733-761  
**Commit**: Breaking news engine bug fix (is_gaining_sources)

---

## üìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX

### **Before Fix (BROKEN)**:
```
Israel hostage story timeline:
10:00 | Created: 3 sources ‚Üí BREAKING ‚úì
10:05 | Gains 4th source ‚Üí is_gaining=False ‚Üí VERIFIED ‚ùå
10:10 | Gains 5th source ‚Üí is_gaining=False ‚Üí VERIFIED ‚ùå
10:15 | Gains 6th source ‚Üí is_gaining=False ‚Üí VERIFIED ‚ùå
```

### **After Fix (WORKING)**:
```
Israel hostage story timeline:
10:00 | Created: 3 sources ‚Üí BREAKING ‚úì
10:05 | Gains 4th source ‚Üí is_gaining=True ‚Üí BREAKING ‚úì
10:10 | Gains 5th source ‚Üí is_gaining=True ‚Üí BREAKING ‚úì
10:15 | Gains 6th source ‚Üí is_gaining=True ‚Üí BREAKING ‚úì
10:45 | No updates for 30 min ‚Üí VERIFIED (by BreakingNewsMonitor)
```

---

## üß™ VERIFICATION STEPS

### **1. Wait for Active Clustering** (10-15 minutes)

New articles need to arrive and cluster to existing stories.

### **2. Check for `is_gaining=True`**:

```bash
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(30m) | where message contains 'is_gaining=True' | project timestamp, message"
```

**Expected**: Stories gaining sources should show `is_gaining=True`.

### **3. Check for BREAKING Promotions**:

```bash
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(30m) | where message contains 'üî• Story promoted to BREAKING' | project timestamp, message"
```

**Expected**: Stories with 3+ sources actively gaining sources should be promoted.

### **4. Monitor Israel-Related Stories**:

```bash
./query-logs.sh custom "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) | where message contains 'israel' or message contains 'gaza' or message contains 'hostage' | where message contains 'BREAKING' or message contains 'Status evaluation' | project timestamp, message"
```

**Expected**: Israel/Gaza stories that gain sources should be promoted to BREAKING.

## üéØ WHY THE FIX WILL WORK

### **Python List Reference Behavior**:

```python
# Example demonstrating the bug:
story = {'source_articles': [1, 2, 3]}
source_articles = story['source_articles']  # REFERENCE, not copy

# WRONG:
source_articles.append(4)  # Modifies story['source_articles']!
prev = len(story['source_articles'])  # Returns 4 (already modified)
is_gaining = len(source_articles) > prev  # 4 > 4 = False ‚ùå

# CORRECT:
prev = len(source_articles)  # Get count FIRST
source_articles.append(4)  # Then modify
is_gaining = len(source_articles) > prev  # 4 > 3 = True ‚úì
```

---

## üìù ADDITIONAL FIXES IN THIS SESSION

### **1. Duplicate Sources Display Bug** (API fix, pending deployment)

**Issue**: iOS showing "CNN, CNN, CNN..." for single-source stories

**Fix**: Deduplicate sources by name in API response

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Code ready, needs API rebuild (Docker required)

---

### **2. Headline Re-evaluation Trigger** (Functions fix, deployed 08:34 UTC)

**Issue**: Headlines only updated at thresholds (3, 5, 10, 15), not on every source

**Fix**: Changed to trigger on EVERY source addition

**Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed, verified working

---

### **3. Restaurant Spam Filter Round 2** (Functions fix, deployed 08:27 UTC)

**Issue**: Restaurant names without descriptions still getting through

**Fix**: Enhanced URL-based detection for `/good-food/` patterns

**Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed

---

### **4. Source Diversity Blocking** (Functions fix, deployed 07:54 UTC)

**Issue**: Stories stuck at low source counts due to strict duplicate checking

**Fix**: Changed from source-level to article-level deduplication

**Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed, verified working

## ‚úÖ ANSWER TO USER

**Q**: "Has the breaking news engine crashed?"

**A**: **No, it hasn't crashed.** The monitor is running perfectly.

**However**, there was a critical Python reference bug that prevented `is_gaining_sources` from ever being `True`, which blocked ongoing stories from being promoted to BREAKING status.

**The bug is fixed and deployed.** Within the next 15-30 minutes, as stories gain sources, you should start seeing them promoted to BREAKING status.

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. ‚úÖ **Wait 15-30 minutes** for clustering activity
2. **Monitor logs** for `is_gaining=True` and BREAKING promotions
3. **Test with live breaking news** (Israel/Gaza stories)
4. **Deploy API fix** for duplicate sources display (requires Docker)

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED & DEPLOYED**

The breaking news engine will now correctly detect and promote ongoing developing stories.
