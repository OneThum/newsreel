## üîç Monitoring Setup

### Application Insights Queries Created

7 custom queries available for monitoring:
1. **Batch Submission Rate** - Track batches submitted over time
2. **Batch Success Rate** - Monitor failure rates (target: >95%)
3. **Stories in Queue Trend** - Watch backlog size
4. **Batch Processing Errors** - Quick error identification
5. **Batch Cost Tracking** - Daily cost monitoring
6. **Batch Size Distribution** - Optimization insights
7. **Batch Processing Time** - Performance tracking

**Location**: Application Insights ‚Üí newsreel-insights ‚Üí Logs

### Alert Rules (Recommended)

| Alert | Threshold | Severity | Status |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| High Failure Rate | >10% failures | Warning | Manual setup required |
| No Submissions | 0 in 2 hours | Info | Manual setup required |
| High Cost | >$5/day | Warning | Manual setup required |
| Large Queue | >200 stories | Info | Manual setup required |
| Slow Processing | >90 minutes | Warning | Manual setup required |

**Note**: Alert creation requires manual setup in Azure Portal (automated creation failed due to CLI limitations)

## üì± Admin Dashboard

### New Metrics Section: "Batch Processing"

Displays:
- **Status**: Enabled/Disabled indicator
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful batch requests
- **Batches Completed (24h)**: X/Y format showing completed vs submitted
- **Avg Batch Size**: Average number of stories per batch
- **Stories in Queue**: Stories waiting for next batch
- **Batch Cost (24h)**: Daily batch processing cost

**Color**: Purple card with `square.stack.3d.up.fill` icon

---

## ‚è∞ Next Batch Run

The `BatchSummarizationManager` function will run:
- **Next execution**: Within 30 minutes
- **Schedule**: Every 30 minutes (`:00`, `:30`)
- **Actions**:
  1. Check and process any completed batches from previous runs
  2. Find stories needing summaries (last 48 hours)
  3. Submit new batch (up to 500 stories)
  4. Create tracking record in `batch_tracking` container

---

## üìã Post-Deployment Actions

### Immediate (Next 30-60 minutes)
1. ‚úÖ Wait for first batch run (automatic)
2. ‚è≥ Check function logs for batch submission
3. ‚è≥ Verify `batch_tracking` container has records
4. ‚è≥ Confirm new summaries use `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`

### Within 24 Hours
1. ‚è≥ Monitor batch success rate (should be >95%)
2. ‚è≥ Verify daily costs dropped to ~$6-7
3. ‚è≥ Check admin dashboard shows batch metrics
4. ‚è≥ Ensure all stories get summaries within 48h

### Manual Setup Required
1. ‚è≥ Create Application Insights alert rules
   - Go to: newsreel-insights ‚Üí Alerts ‚Üí Create alert rule
   - Use thresholds from table above
2. ‚è≥ Save custom queries in Application Insights
   - Go to: newsreel-insights ‚Üí Logs
   - Copy queries from monitoring script output
3. ‚è≥ Create Azure Dashboard
   - Pin batch metrics for quick visibility
4. ‚è≥ Optional: Disable old backfill function
   - Set `SUMMARIZATION_BACKFILL_ENABLED=false`
   - Once satisfied batch processing is working

## üîß Quick Commands

### Check Function Logs
```bash
func azure functionapp logstream newsreel-func-51689 --browser
# Or
az webapp log tail --name newsreel-func-51689 --resource-group Newsreel-RG
```

### Query Batch Tracking
```sql
-- In Cosmos DB Data Explorer
SELECT * FROM c 
WHERE c.status = 'in_progress' 
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC
```

### Check Recent Summaries
```sql
SELECT c.id, c.summary.model, c.summary.cost_usd, c.summary.batch_processed
FROM c 
WHERE IS_DEFINED(c.summary) 
ORDER BY c.summary.generated_at DESC 
OFFSET 0 LIMIT 10
```

### Verify Batch Function Status
```bash
az functionapp function show \
  --name newsreel-func-51689 \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --function-name BatchSummarizationManager
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### No Batches Submitting
1. Check `BATCH_PROCESSING_ENABLED=true`
2. Verify stories need summaries (query Cosmos DB)
3. Check function logs for errors

### Batch Failures
1. Check Application Insights for error messages
2. Verify Anthropic API key is valid
3. Check batch_tracking container for error details

### High Costs
1. Review batch_cost_24h in admin dashboard
2. Check if batch sizes are too large
3. Verify cache hit rates in Application Insights

### Admin Dashboard Not Showing Batch Metrics
1. API may need restart after deployment
2. Check iOS app is using updated models
3. Verify API endpoint returns batch_processing field
