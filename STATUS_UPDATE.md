# Status Update - Iteration 14

## Critical Issue Identified

### Root Cause
Cosmos DB database and containers are missing from the Azure deployment.

### Impact
- Function App cannot connect to database
- No data can be processed  
- Clustering pipeline completely blocked
- System is non-functional despite all tests passing locally

### Current Status
- ✅ Unit tests: 54/54 (100%)
- ✅ Integration tests: 59/59 (100%)  
- ⚠️  System tests: 2/6 (database connection issues)
- ⚠️  Deployed system: Non-functional

### Next Steps
1. Recreate Cosmos DB database and containers
2. Verify Function App connection
3. Test data ingestion and clustering
4. Run full system tests
