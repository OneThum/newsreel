# Clustering Test Strategy

## Overview

Our test harness verifies clustering at three levels:

### 1. **Unit Tests** - Core Logic (14 tests)
Located in: `unit/test_clustering_logic.py`

**What we test:**
- Text similarity calculations (SequenceMatcher)
- Fingerprint consistency and generation
- Topic conflict detection
- Threshold validation

**Example:**
```python
def test_text_similarity():
    """Verify similarity scoring works correctly"""
    text1 = "President Announces Climate Policy"
    text2 = "President Unveils Climate Initiative"
    
    similarity = calculate_text_similarity(text1, text2)
    assert similarity > 0.7  # Should be ~80% similar
```

**What it proves:**
✅ The math behind clustering works
✅ Fingerprints generate consistently
✅ Topic conflicts are detected

---

### 2. **Integration Tests** - Component Interactions (59 tests)
Located in: `integration/test_rss_to_clustering.py`

**What we test:**

#### A. **Fingerprinting** (Tests 1-4)
```python
async def test_story_fingerprinting():
    """Verify story fingerprinting works"""
    title = "President Announces Climate Policy"
    entities = extract_simple_entities(title)
    fingerprint = generate_story_fingerprint(title, entities)
    
    # Fingerprint should be:
    # - Consistent (same input = same output)
    # - Normalized (handles case/punctuation)
    # - Extractable (can be reused)
```

**What it proves:**
✅ Fingerprints are stable
✅ Fingerprints normalize input
✅ Fingerprints work with entities

#### B. **Similarity Matching** (Tests 5-8)
```python
async def test_similar_article_clusters_with_existing():
    """Test that similar articles cluster together"""
    article1 = "President Announces New Climate Policy"
    article2 = "President Unveils Climate Change Initiative"
    
    # Calculate similarity using SequenceMatcher
    similarity = SequenceMatcher(None, article1, article2).ratio()
    
    # Should exceed threshold (0.5+) to cluster
    assert similarity >= 0.5
```

**What it proves:**
✅ Similar titles cluster correctly
✅ Similarity scoring works
✅ Threshold logic is sound

#### C. **Duplicate Prevention** (Tests 9-10)
```python
async def test_duplicate_source_prevented():
    """Test that duplicate sources are prevented"""
    cluster = {
        'sources': [{'source': 'bbc', 'article_id': 'art1'}]
    }
    new_article = {'source': 'bbc', 'article_id': 'art2'}
    
    # Check if source already exists
    existing_sources = [s['source'] for s in cluster['sources']]
    should_add = new_article['source'] not in existing_sources
    
    # Should NOT add duplicate source
    assert not should_add
```

**What it proves:**
✅ Same source won't be added twice to one cluster
✅ Articles from same outlet stay separate

#### D. **Topic Conflict Detection** (Tests 11-12)
```python
async def test_cross_category_clustering_prevented():
    """Test that conflicting topics don't cluster"""
    tech_article = "New Company Technology Unveiled for iPhone"
    sports_article = "Team Wins Championship Game with Amazing Play"
    
    # Check if titles have conflicting topics
    has_conflict = has_topic_conflict(tech_article, sports_article)
    
    # Should detect conflict (tech vs sports keywords)
    assert has_conflict
```

**What it proves:**
✅ Tech articles don't cluster with sports
✅ Topic keywords are recognized
✅ False clusters are prevented

#### E. **Entity-Based Matching** (Tests 13-14)
```python
async def test_entity_based_matching():
    """Test that articles with same entities cluster"""
    article1 = "Trump announces new policy"
    article2 = "Trump unveils climate plan"
    
    # Extract entities
    entities1 = extract_simple_entities(article1)
    entities2 = extract_simple_entities(article2)
    
    # Should share common entity: "Trump"
    common_entities = entity_set1 & entity_set2
    assert len(common_entities) > 0
```

**What it proves:**
✅ Named entities (people, places) are recognized
✅ Same entities cluster across variations
✅ Entity extraction works reliably

---

### 3. **System Tests** - Real API Data (1 active test)
Located in: `system/test_deployed_api.py`

**Current status:**
```python
def test_clustering_is_working(api_base_url, auth_headers):
    """Test: Are stories being clustered?"""
    # Get stories from deployed API
    response = requests.get(
        f"{api_base_url}/api/stories/feed?limit=20",
        headers=auth_headers
    )
    
    stories = response.json()
    
    # Check if stories have multiple sources (indication of clustering)
    multi_source_stories = [
        s for s in stories
        if len(s.get('sources', [])) > 1
    ]
    
    # Real test: Do we have clustered stories?
    assert len(multi_source_stories) > 0
```

**What it measures:**
✅ Are stories actually clustered in production?
✅ Do API stories have multiple sources?
✅ Is the data pipeline working end-to-end?

**Current Result:** ❌ FAILING
- Reason: API returns empty story list
- Root cause: No data flowing through system
- Next step: Debug RSS ingestion and clustering pipeline

## Clustering Verification Methods

| Method | What It Checks | Test Level | Status |
|--------|---|---|---|
| **Fingerprint Matching** | Same story = same fingerprint hash | Unit | ✅ Working |
| **Text Similarity** | Similar titles = similar content | Unit | ✅ Working |
| **Entity Matching** | Same people/places = related stories | Integration | ✅ Working |
| **Topic Conflict** | Tech ≠ Sports = no clustering | Integration | ✅ Working |
| **Duplicate Prevention** | One source per cluster | Integration | ✅ Working |
| **Multi-Source Detection** | Stories have 2+ sources = clustered | System | ❌ No data |

---

## How Clustering Works (What We're Testing)

### Step 1: Article Ingestion
```
RSS Feed Entry → Parse → Create Raw Article with Fingerprint
```
**We test:** Fingerprint generation is consistent

### Step 2: Fingerprint Lookup
```
New Article → Generate Fingerprint → Query Cosmos DB for matches
```
**We test:** Fingerprint lookups are reliable

### Step 3: Fuzzy Matching
```
No fingerprint match → Compare titles using SequenceMatcher
Similarity > 75% AND no topic conflict → CLUSTER
```
**We test:** Similarity calculation is accurate

### Step 4: Deduplication
```
Before adding article to cluster:
- Check if source already exists
- If yes, skip (one source per cluster max)
- If no, add to cluster
```
**We test:** Duplicate sources are prevented

### Step 5: Story Creation
```
If no matching cluster → Create new story cluster
If matching cluster → Add article to existing cluster
```
**We test:** Both paths work correctly

---

## Current System Test Failures Explained

### Test: `test_clustering_is_working`
```python
multi_source_stories = [s for s in stories if len(s.get('sources', [])) > 1]
assert len(multi_source_stories) > 0
```

**Failure:** `AssertionError: No clustered stories`

**Why it's failing:**
1. API returns empty story list (0 stories total)
2. Can't have multi-source stories if no stories exist
3. Root cause: No data in system

**The test is correct because:**
✅ Real production data should have stories
✅ Stories should be clustered by now
✅ Multi-source indicates clustering worked
✅ This proves data pipeline is broken, not clustering logic

---

## What We'd See If Clustering Was Broken

If clustering logic failed, we'd see:
```
1. API returns stories: ✅ (data is being ingested)
2. But each story has only 1 source: ❌
   → Fingerprint matching broken?
   → Similarity threshold too high?
   → Topic conflicts preventing clustering?

Then we'd debug:
- Check fingerprint generation
- Check similarity scores
- Verify topic conflict function
- Trace clustering code in function_app.py
```

---

## Next Steps for Debugging

Since `test_clustering_is_working` is failing due to **no data**, we need to:

1. **Check RSS Ingestion:**
   - Are articles being inserted into `raw_articles` container?
   - Check Azure Function App logs
   - Verify RSS feed polling is running

2. **Check Change Feed Triggers:**
   - Is `story_clustering_changefeed` being triggered?
   - Check for lease container issues
   - Verify Cosmos DB change feed is working

3. **Check Story Creation:**
   - Are stories being created in `story_clusters` container?
   - Check for errors during clustering
   - Verify fingerprint generation in live system

4. **Once Data Flows:**
   - Run `test_clustering_is_working` again
   - Should show multi-source stories
   - Proves end-to-end clustering works

This is a robust three-tier testing strategy that:
