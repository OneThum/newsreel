## When to Use

### `cleanup_old_articles.py` ‚úÖ
**Good for**:
- Testing with fresh data
- Reducing database costs
- Maintaining a small test dataset
- Keeping last hour of data for debugging

**Example scenarios**:
- "I want to test RSS ingestion with a clean slate but keep recent articles"
- "Database is too large, trim it down to recent data"
- "Need to free up space but not lose everything"

### `cleanup_all_articles.py` ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Good for**:
- Complete system reset
- Starting from scratch
- Clearing test data entirely
- Troubleshooting database corruption

**Example scenarios**:
- "I want to completely reset the system"
- "Need to clear all test data before going live"
- "Database has corrupt data, need fresh start"

### When NOT to use ‚ùå
**DON'T USE IN PRODUCTION** unless you know exactly what you're doing!

These scripts are designed for **testing/development** environments.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No articles to delete"
- Database is already empty
- Check connection string in `.env`

### "Failed to delete X articles"
- Network issues
- Permission issues
- First 5 errors are shown

### "Connection failed"
- Check `COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING` in `.env`
- Verify Cosmos DB is accessible
- Check network connection

---

## Recovery

### If you deleted by accident:
1. **Stop immediately** (Ctrl+C)
2. Articles deleted so far are **gone forever**
3. Remaining articles are **still in database**
4. Check what's left:
   ```bash
   cd Azure/tests
   python3 diagnostics/check_rss_ingestion.py
   ```

### No backup/restore:
‚ö†Ô∏è  These scripts **do not create backups**  
‚ö†Ô∏è  Deletion is **permanent and immediate**  
‚ö†Ô∏è  No "undo" or "restore" functionality

**Prevention is the only solution** - read prompts carefully!

## Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ Read all warnings
2. ‚úÖ Verify you're in correct environment
3. ‚úÖ Check `.env` points to correct database
4. ‚úÖ Consider if you really need to delete
5. ‚úÖ Announce to team if shared database

### During Running
1. ‚úÖ Read each prompt carefully
2. ‚úÖ Type confirmations exactly as shown
3. ‚úÖ Don't run if uncertain
4. ‚úÖ Watch progress output
5. ‚úÖ Can abort with Ctrl+C

### After Running
1. ‚úÖ Verify results in summary
2. ‚úÖ Check health report dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Run diagnostics to verify state
4. ‚úÖ Restart RSS ingestion if needed

## Technical Details

### What Gets Deleted

**Articles Container** (`raw_articles`):
- ‚úÖ All raw article documents
- ‚úÖ All ingestion metadata
- ‚úÖ All processing flags

**Stories Container** (`story_clusters`):
- ‚ùå NOT deleted (kept intact)
- Stories remain but may have broken source links

### Deletion Method
- Uses Cosmos DB `delete_item()` API
- Requires both `id` and `partition_key`
- Processes one article at a time
- No batch deletion (safer)

### Performance
- **Speed**: ~100-500 articles/second
- **145,000 articles**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Progress updates**: Every 100 articles
