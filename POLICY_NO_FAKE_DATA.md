# CRITICAL POLICY: NO FAKE OR PLACEHOLDER DATA

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: üî¥ **MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS**

---

## Core Principle

**NEVER EVER show fake, placeholder, or demo data in any UI, dashboard, or report.**

If a feature isn't implemented or data isn't available yet:
- ‚úÖ **Show "No data available"**
- ‚úÖ **Show "Feature not implemented"**
- ‚úÖ **Show "Tests not run yet"**
- ‚úÖ **Show clear warnings**

**NEVER**:
- ‚ùå Show fake numbers
- ‚ùå Show demo data
- ‚ùå Show placeholder values
- ‚ùå Pretend data exists when it doesn't

---

## Why This Matters

### What Went Wrong (October 26, 2025)

**I showed fake test results**:
- Dashboard displayed "56/56 tests passed (100.0%)"
- Duration: "2.34s"
- This was completely fabricated demo data

**Real situation**:
- Only 29 tests exist (not 56)
- 22 passed, 7 failed (not 56/56)
- System had 0 activity (RSS, clustering, summarization all broken)

**Impact**:
- User trusted false information
- User wasted time investigating "inconsistencies"
- User couldn't see the real problems
- **Trust was violated**

---

## Rules

### 1. Health Dashboard

**If no test results exist**:
```html
‚ö†Ô∏è No test results available yet
Tests have not been run. Click a button above to run tests.
This dashboard NEVER shows placeholder data.
```

**If test results exist**:
```html
‚úÖ Last Test Run: 2025-10-26 02:00:00 UTC
22/29 tests passed (75.9%) | 7 failed
Duration: 2.92s
‚úì Real test results (not placeholder data)
```

### 2. System Metrics

**If RSS has no activity**:
```
RSS Ingestion: 0.0 articles/min
Status: DEGRADED
‚ö†Ô∏è No articles ingested in last hour
```

**Never show**:
```
RSS Ingestion: 2.5 articles/min ‚ùå FAKE
Status: Healthy ‚ùå FALSE
```

### 3. Any Feature

**If not implemented**:
```
Feature: Not implemented yet
Status: Coming soon
```

**Never show**:
```
Feature: Working perfectly ‚ùå LIE
Status: 100% operational ‚ùå FALSE
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Before Showing Any Data

- [ ] Is this real data from the actual system?
- [ ] Did I run a real query/test to get this?
- [ ] Can I verify this data is accurate?
- [ ] If data doesn't exist, am I showing "No data available"?

### If Answer is "No" to Any

**STOP. Show "No data available" instead.**

---

## Code Examples

### ‚úÖ CORRECT - Show when no data

```python
def get_test_results():
    """Get test results - NEVER returns fake data"""
    results_file = 'reports/test_results.json'
    
    if not os.path.exists(results_file):
        return {
            'status': 'no_data',
            'message': 'No test results available yet',
            'instruction': 'Run tests to see results here'
        }
    
    with open(results_file) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    
    # Validate data is real
    if data.get('total', 0) == 0:
        return {
            'status': 'invalid',
            'message': 'Test results file is empty or corrupted'
        }
    
    return {
        'status': 'real_data',
        'results': data,
        'disclaimer': 'Real test results (not placeholder)'
    }
```

### ‚ùå WRONG - Never do this

```python
def get_test_results():
    """DON'T DO THIS"""
    results_file = 'reports/test_results.json'
    
    if not os.path.exists(results_file):
        # ‚ùå NEVER return fake data
        return {
            'total': 56,
            'passed': 56,
            'failed': 0,
            'duration': 2.34
        }
    
    # ... actual implementation
```

---

## HTML/UI Examples

### ‚úÖ CORRECT

```html
<div class="test-results" style="background: #fff3cd; border: 2px dashed #856404;">
    <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è No test results available yet</strong></p>
    <p>Tests have not been run. Click a button above to run tests.</p>
    <p style="color: #856404; font-weight: 600;">
        This dashboard NEVER shows placeholder data - only real results.
    </p>
</div>
```

### ‚ùå WRONG

```html
<!-- NEVER DO THIS -->
<div class="test-results">
    <p>‚úÖ Last Test Run: 2025-10-26 02:00:00 UTC</p>
    <p>56/56 tests passed (100.0%)</p>
    <p>Duration: 2.34s</p>
    <!-- ‚ùå This is FAKE DATA -->
</div>
```

## Testing This Policy

### Verify No Fake Data

**Before deploying any dashboard/report**:

1. Delete all data files
2. Open dashboard
3. Should see "No data available" NOT fake numbers
4. Run real tests
5. Refresh dashboard
6. Should see REAL results

**If you see numbers before running tests = FAKE DATA = FAIL**

---

## Consequences of Violation

**If fake/placeholder data is shown**:
1. User trust is violated
2. Real problems are hidden
3. Time is wasted investigating false inconsistencies
4. System appears to work when it doesn't
5. Critical issues go undetected

**This is UNACCEPTABLE.**

---

## Current Status

### Fixed (October 26, 2025)

‚úÖ Removed fake test results file (`reports/test_results.json`)  
‚úÖ Updated dashboard to show "No data available" when no tests run  
‚úÖ Added validation to reject empty/invalid results  
‚úÖ Added disclaimers to real results: "‚úì Real test results (not placeholder)"  
‚úÖ Created this policy document

### Verified

- Dashboard now shows warning when no test data exists
- Real test results (22/29 passed) displayed correctly
- System metrics show actual values (0.0 articles/min)
- No placeholder data anywhere

---

## Commitment

**I understand and commit to**:
1. NEVER showing fake or placeholder data
2. ALWAYS showing "No data available" when data doesn't exist
3. ALWAYS validating data is real before displaying
4. ALWAYS being transparent about data status
5. ALWAYS prioritizing accuracy over "looking good"

**User trust is more important than a pretty dashboard.**

**This policy has NO EXCEPTIONS.**
