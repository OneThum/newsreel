# CLUSTERING ALGORITHM FIXED - October 18, 2025, 21:08 UTC

## CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED AND FIXED ✅

The clustering algorithm was **completely broken** due to multiple issues:

### Root Causes Found:

1. **Wrong Similarity Threshold**: 
   - **Config**: `0.85` (85% similarity required)
   - **Actual Code**: Hardcoded `0.50` (50% similarity)
   - **Result**: Unrelated stories clustered together

2. **Overly Aggressive Similarity Function**:
   - Keyword overlap weighted at 50% (too high)
   - Entity boost of 20% for 3+ matches
   - Designed to be "AGGRESSIVE" for broader matching
   - **Result**: Stories with minimal keyword overlap scored high

3. **Multiple Hardcoded Thresholds**:
   - Entity matching: `0.40` (40%)
   - Logging threshold: `0.35` (35%)
   - **Result**: Inconsistent clustering behavior

## FIXES APPLIED ✅

### 1. Fixed Similarity Threshold
**Before**:
```python
if title_similarity > 0.50:  # Hardcoded 50%
```

**After**:
```python
if title_similarity > config.STORY_FINGERPRINT_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD:  # Uses 85%
```

### 2. Made Similarity Function Conservative
**Before** (Aggressive):
```python
# Keyword overlap: 50% (dominant)
# Entity matching: 30%
# Boost: +20% for 3+ entities
final_score = (keyword_score * 0.50) + (entity_score * 0.30) + ...
if entity_overlap >= 3:
    final_score = min(1.0, final_score * 1.2)  # 20% boost
```

**After** (Conservative):
```python
# Keyword overlap: 40% (balanced)
# Entity matching: 40% (increased importance)
# NO BOOST - prevents false positives
final_score = (keyword_score * 0.40) + (entity_score * 0.40) + ...
# No boost applied
```

### 3. Raised All Thresholds
- Entity matching: `0.40` → `0.70`
- Logging threshold: `0.35` → `0.60`

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Changed from "AGGRESSIVE" to "CONSERVATIVE"
- Updated comments to reflect prevention of false clustering

## EXPECTED RESULTS

### Before Fix:
- Stories about "Asia's youngest nation" clustered with:
  - "California sues Trump administration over Solar for All"
  - "North Macedonia votes amid EU membership"
  - "Military leader sworn in as Madagascar's new president"
  - "Kenya police fire at mourners"
  - "Government Shutdown Day 15"
  - "Facebook removes ICE-tracking page"

### After Fix:
- **85% similarity threshold**: Only truly related stories will cluster
- **Conservative scoring**: Prevents false positives
- **Balanced weights**: Entity matching and keyword overlap equally important
- **No artificial boosts**: Scores stand on their own merit

---

## IMPACT ON STORY CLUSTERING

### Immediate Effect:
- **New articles**: Will only cluster with truly related stories (85%+ similarity)
- **Existing clusters**: Will remain unchanged (no retroactive changes)
- **False clustering**: Should stop immediately for new articles

### Long-term Effect:
- **Better accuracy**: Stories about the same event will cluster correctly
- **Fewer false positives**: Unrelated stories won't be grouped together
- **Higher quality clusters**: Multi-source stories will be more coherent

---

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS ✅

- **Functions deployed**: 21:08 UTC
- **Config updated**: Claude Haiku 3.5 model
- **Thresholds fixed**: All hardcoded values replaced with config
- **Similarity function**: Made conservative

---

## TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Monitor New Clusters:
1. Check if new articles cluster correctly
2. Verify unrelated stories don't get grouped
3. Confirm multi-source stories are coherent

### Expected Behavior:
- **Same event, different sources**: Should cluster (e.g., "Trump announces policy" + "President unveils approach")
- **Different events**: Should NOT cluster (e.g., "Asia nation" + "California lawsuit")
- **Similar topics, different events**: Should NOT cluster (e.g., "Trump policy A" + "Trump policy B")

---

## COST IMPLICATIONS

### Claude Haiku 3.5:
- **Input**: $0.25 per 1M tokens (vs $3 for Sonnet)
- **Output**: $1.25 per 1M tokens (vs $15 for Sonnet)
- **Savings**: ~92% cheaper for summarization

### Clustering Accuracy:
- **Before**: Many false clusters → wasted summarization on unrelated stories
- **After**: Accurate clusters → summaries only for truly related stories
- **Result**: Better quality + lower costs

---

**STATUS**: Clustering algorithm fixed and deployed. New articles should cluster correctly with 85% similarity threshold. Existing broken clusters will remain but new ones should be accurate.
