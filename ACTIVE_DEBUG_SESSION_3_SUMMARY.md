# Active Debug Session 3: Container Cleanup and Next Steps

## Status
- ✅ story_clusters container successfully DELETED and RECREATED clean
- ✅ feed_poll_states container exists (created in session 2)
- ✅ Function App restarted to initialize clustering on empty container
- ⏳ API Container timing out after restart (needs stabilization time)

## What Was Accomplished
1. ✅ Identified that story_clusters had 107 feed_poll_state documents
2. ✅ Successfully deleted story_clusters container completely
3. ✅ Recreated story_clusters with clean schema (partition key: /category)
4. ✅ Restarted Function App to reinitialize clustering trigger
5. ✅ Verified feed_poll_states container exists

## Current State
- Raw articles: ~3,000+ still being ingested
- Story clusters: 0 (clean, waiting for clustering)
- Feed poll states: ~150+ (now in correct container)
- API: Timing out (needs more stabilization time)

## Root Cause Analysis
The original problem (107 feed_poll_state docs in story_clusters) has been resolved. The system was likely blocked because:
1. Change feed trigger expected story_cluster documents
2. Found feed_poll_state documents instead
3. Stopped processing due to schema mismatch

## Next Session Actions
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for API Container to fully stabilize
2. **Run diagnostic** to check if story documents appearing in story_clusters
3. **Monitor logs** for clustering function execution
4. **Test API** for story data response
5. **Verify** end-to-end pipeline

## Key Command for Next Session
```bash
# Run diagnostic to check pipeline state
python3 Azure/scripts/diagnose-clustering-pipeline.py

# If stories exist, test API
cd Azure/tests
pytest system/test_deployed_api.py -v

# If still issues, restart API container
az containerapp revision list --name newsreel-api \
  --resource-group Newsreel-RG \
  --query "[0].name" -o tsv | xargs -I {} az containerapp revision deactivate \
  --name newsreel-api --resource-group Newsreel-RG --revision {}
```

## Expected Behavior When Fixed
- Clustering function processes 3,000+ raw articles
- Creates story documents in story_clusters (grouped by similar content)
- Story count should grow to 500-1000+ within 5-10 minutes
- API returns stories in response (no longer empty array)

## Session Progress
Session 1: 54% → 70% (container fix + auth prep)
Session 2: 70% → Auth working, clustering blocked
Session 3: ✅ Cleared blockers, now waiting for pipeline to initialize
Session 4: Should be ready for full testing and validation

## Status: ⏳ Awaiting Clustering Initialization
The infrastructure is now clean and ready. Next session should verify clustering is processing the raw articles and creating story documents.
